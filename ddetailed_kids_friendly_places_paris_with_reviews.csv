Came early on a Friday morning, one of their first customers. Their coffee was surprisingly really good! We ordered an americano and latte. My husband and I don‚Äôt drink coffee often but we loved it here. It came with pain au chocolate which were divine with our espressos. We also had the croque madame, good balance of meat, cheese and sunny side up egg but the toast underneath was a little dry. Still good nonetheless. Our waitress was so nice and sweet. Loved the atmosphere of this restaurant! Clean bathrooms.; Location top and staff amazing and super friendly! We had a brunch this morning and WOW! Food is super tasty ! We will definitely come back! Ps: un gracias especial a Federico, que ha sido s√∫per simp√°tico y habla un italiano perfecto! üòâüòâüòâ
A big thanks to everyone.. we will definitely come back! Giulia & Sara from Italy üáÆüáπ; Second visit, the first being brunch.
Very friendly and the place was buzzing for dinner tonight. The host and staff were attentive and even helped with our struggles with french yet made us feel at ease. The menu was available online in English which was greatly appreciated. Food was excellent and the staff even went a little more than needed with service. I Enjoyed three courses and would happily eat here again.; Great place, amazing service, cute interior, very good food. We had the Eggs Benedict with Cheddar and Ham (‚Ç¨15) and it‚Äôs just like you‚Äôd wish them. They have full brunch menu for ‚Ç¨25 with drinks included. There‚Äôs space for improvement for the Home Made Iced Tea, though. The taste is very faded, basically flavoured water and does not correspond to the price (‚Ç¨5). Still this place gets 5 stars from me for everything else.; Went on a Sunday morning for a buffet. It was excellent, pic below is part of what they offered, there was more ‚Ä¶.The food was perfect from the eggs right down to the hot chocolate. 10/10, the price was worth the experience and quality of food and service.

The food is pretty good, so are the cocktails.

The backyard is calm and nicely decorated, it's awesome during a sunny day.; Cozy place, caring waiter, pleasant general atmosphere. We weren't disappointed by the dinner at this place.

The waiter is very friendly. Even though he can barely speak English but still tries to communicate as much as he can. The menu is very simple. You either choose 2 courses pairing the mains with entrees or dessert for 28 Euros or all 3 courses for 36 Euros. All the items in each course is written in French onto the chalkboard. So i presume it is changed regularly. Though I can't understand French,  its easily overcome with Google Lens . The entree of squid and chorizo sausages in an orange thick soup was a pleasant surprise. For the mains I tried beef tatare for the first time and it tastes good. Ended meal with a chocolate mousse with sea salt. The waiter was a one man show handling many tables so each course took some time to arrive which was understandable. Hope the restaurant can find some help soon for this kind gentleman :); Great casual spot.
Came for a Thursday night dinner. Service was very good and the staff is very nice. The place is quiet and chill and away of the street‚Äôs bustle.
Buratta and the apricot crumble were the highlight of the evening.
Beef fillet was also good, but nothing too exciting.; We were looking for a fine dine restaurant, this was recommended by our hotel staff, and surprisingly this was indeed a good experience. Price it's reasonable, portions are great, great service! The only improvement I see are the desserts, they are too heavy by my taste, but definitely does not affect overall experience.; The restaurant was an absolutely fantastic discovery having come here for dinner with a friend! We chose it judging by all the positive reviews & we weren't disappointed üòç Every dish that we ordered was absolutely exquisite!! We had the burrata as a starter, the dorade ceviche as a main and the seasonal crumble, as well S the mousse au chocolat for dessert - each and every one of them was a little wow experience ü§Ø The prices were fair for the outstanding quality - 27‚Ç¨ for a starter + a main dish or a main dish + a dessert; or 35‚Ç¨ for all the three courses. I had a white wine suggested which fit perfectly with the food and all in all, the service was so warm and welcoming, which is extremely refreshing in the world of grumpy Parisian waiters üòÖ The only thing to mention, is that it would be great to have some more qualitative tea instead of just Lipton in a tea bag üòè It's located in a little hidden street, so it's really calm & away from all the noise of the cars, while being super central, it's simply the perfect mix!!! We will be back for sure & I have already suggested it to other friends ‚ô•Ô∏è; It was a nice fixed price menu place. My favorites were the mushroom soup starter and the desserts. For my entr√©e I had the steak tartare, and I guess it's one of those things I can check off the list as having tried. They've got plenty of wines to choose from, if that's your thing.",75009

The founders, Laura and Kaja are very kind and attentive who created the most amazing place for families. Did I mention¬† there's a bf pillow, changing table, several children's size toilets, all in a beautiful, clean and hygienic bathroom? Seriously, the list goes on.; I had the luck to find this lovely caf√© just after they opened. Inside it‚Äôs spacious and full of light, and very family/child friendly.

Charlie runs front of house and the drinks, and only two chefs out the back.

Food service is perfectly paced and allows you to enjoy the food and the company.

We loved it so much we went twice in five days. Merci Charlie!; The food was incredible, really good quality ingredients cooked to perfection. The portions are really generous and the service could not be better. A really pleasant surprise,  excellent attention to details and friendly atmosphere. Also very reasonable price, will definitely come back in future visits to Paris, without a doubt; Outstanding small place in the 15th Arr. We had great food starting with roast St Marcelin cheese. Mains were roast Angus beef, crusted chicken and the ‚Äúfamily‚Äù burger. Each had an outstanding sauce to enhance the flavor. The beef was tender, the chicken moist and the burger was tall and tasty on a brioche. The desserts were a tiramisu of whipped cream, Oreos and raspberries; chocolate lava cake, and saut√©ed plums. The whipped cream was delicious but the plums were the stand out of the evening, drenched in warm sugar caramel sauce. Great service despite one man handling all duties. Search this place out!!; We stumbled upon this French restaurant by chance, and what a delightful surprise it was! From the moment we walked in, we were warmly welcomed by the lone waiter, who, despite managing all the tables on his own, was incredibly professional and friendly. His attention to detail and kindness really added to our experience

The meal was simply amazing. We started with two appetizers: rillettes and terrine. We loved the option to share these dishes as a family, which made the experience even more enjoyable. Even though we're Irish, we absolutely fell in love with these authentic French flavors

As for the main courses, both the parents and the young adults were equally impressed. The tagine was beautifully aromatic, with perfectly balanced flavors and excellent cooking. The ribs were unbelievably tender, falling off the bone effortlessly, and with an excellent sauce. Every dish we tried was outstanding, prepared with great care and passion i think !!

Whether you're with friends or family, this is the perfect spot to enjoy authentic cuisine, all complemented by impeccable service, even when the waiter is handling the whole room on his own. Hats off to them, and thank you for an unforgettable evening !!!",75015

Wandering the streets looking for a nice address, we found this cozy joint next to place des Vosges, with a sunday brunch menu !

We tried the 3 brunch main courses, and they were all 3 DELICIOUS !
Eggs with salmon, potato galette with cream cheese.
My favourite was the bun with mozzarella and coppa di parma ; incredibly tasty
and the 3rd and most original was pupkin pancakes with cheese, topped with beets and salad !
Simple, tasty, and copious !
Their juices were really good too ; I tried the refreshing apple, cucumber, lemon shake !

The savoury ham, cheese and egg crepe was really crispy and savoury. I preferred the sweet crepe with ice cream and caramel more. It wasn't overly sweet. Everything went really well with the cider.

This was down the street and it‚Äôs had a few things going for it: an menu that had a few intriguing dishes, a hip looking crowd, and the guy that met me at the door was pretty inviting.

I ended getting a cuttlefish and potato salad with an onion dressing and a vegetarian lasagne. Both dishes really hit it out of the park for me. I‚Äôm normally leaning carnivore, but had been overdoing it on the trip so far, and so I was happily surprised that the veg lasagne was possible the best veg one I‚Äôve ever had.

I was also peaking at the tables by me and the burrata avocado tomato salad also looked great, and the frites looked home made and home style with skins and plenty of dark bits on the edges.",75019

We sat over 5 minutes to get our menue. We then walked in and asked for it. We got two menues, one normal and one for the special lunch offer. Then had to wait 10 more minutes for the waiter to come get our order....

One of my friends wanted food from normal menue, water then says ""no, we only serve from the ""lunch"" menue."" So why did you give us both menues??

They only had three alternatives for lunch meal. Since she had to pick one she then ask if she could then have her food without the saus. The waiter say ""no"" it pre-made.

They showed no will to meet our wishes. Waiter then gets angry that we are asking them to make adjustment to the food and gets an attitude, raises his voice and looks angry. Since she can not have her meal with the sauce, so if they can not do this they loos all three costumers. But he does not care. We left. Would never go back. Bad costumer service",75020

The staff were super friendly and spoke fluent English.; I ordered a beef steak and was surprised when they brought a medium rare. By default in every restaurant I've ever been it's medium.

Medium rare is still smth that I eat but it was unevenly fried and a half of the steak was completely raw. Although I was very hungry raw is not what I can eat.

The waitress didn't even bother to ask why I didn't finish my steak. Overall she looked tired, unhappy and at the same time busy - she was the only one to serve all the tables.

Coffee, really not good at all. I had a coffee earlier the day at the excellent Casa (specialty coffee Paris XII).

There‚Äôs a large window looking into the playroom so parents can watch their kids but also have a bit of space to themselves, very family friendly and innovative. The atmosphere is very pleasant and welcoming; there‚Äôs mostly locals who stop by here but Ernestine Cafe is also very tourist friendly because the workers speak and understand English well.

The menu is diverse and creative, with all the food being made in house. They have a restroom in the back which makes it convenient to spend some time here. I ordered their brunch and left quiet full and content, will definitely stop by the next time I‚Äôm in Paris!; It is a very cosy and charming cafe with a special area for children. While our one year daughter is playing we can enjoy excellent macchiato. Don't miss this place if you have young kids and like very good coffee.; Super cosy and relaxing shop.; Cute cafe with play area for kids and delicacies to die for!",75018

The staff were nice and friendly. We got their sirloin steak with shallot cream and one with morel (mushroom) sauce, and duck breast. We also got the creme brulee, lemon tart and chocolate fondant with ice cream for dessert.; We loved everything here!
The service was great and we were greeted by a smile as soon as we arrived.

Food came out super quickly and was delicious. Great portion as well, so great value for money. Cocktails were tasty and refreshing for these hot summer afternoons.

Ambience was one of the things I liked the most. Soothing and relaxing, allowing for you to properly enjoy your food and take a breath, despite being located in a busy street.

100% recommend.; Alfredo is great! The dishes he recommended were surprisingly good. We ordered the lamb, goat cheese salad, charcuterie board, and French onion soup. To top off a great dinner he treated us to mint shots that we loved. Give this place a try!; We decided to try this place out after seeing all the fantastic reviews, but upon arrival, we almost thought we were at the wrong place‚Äîit looked almost like a PMU from the outside! However, stepping inside changed our minds instantly. The interior is surprisingly cute, and it was bustling with energy during our Saturday brunch visit.

There's even a piano set up for their piano nights, adding a charming touch. The staff was incredibly friendly, which made our experience even better.
The food? Absolutely delightful. I had the foie gras and salade p√©rigourdine as starters, which were hearty enough to be mains, followed by the succulent souris d‚Äôagneau. The portions were generous across the board, definitely making it worth the money.

I would heartily recommend this spot and affirm that it truly deserves its high ratings, especially for the quality of the cuisine.; Amazing little gem. Very good food. Very nice staff and they helped me with my gastric bypass needs. Food was delicious steak was a little undercooked because I asked for medium rare but I got rare. No big problem was tasty nonetheless!",75009

p.s. there is a secret in one of the cabinets; To be avoided, the food was tasteless, the pork dry and the wine not good. Plus super expensive for what it is (more than 70 euros per person). The restaurants on rue Belleville are much better and original, and at a fraction of the price. The waiters were nice though.; Waitress very rude and agressive, rolled her eyes when I had a question about the menu. She kept trying to remove the plates before it was finished.

The restaurant is really compact and space is scarce to move around. The service is very good, attentive, helpful and prompt. The five stars are for the great service really and not so much for the food - I have had better. Reservations are required in advance as it gets busy. It seems overpriced to me.; Our second time in Les Enfants Rouges was interesting. Definitely reserve your table in advance, the place is packed. Cozy atmosphere. Staff is super nice. Best dish-desert. Both Pavlova and Cheese cake were superb. Lamb chops were delicious. Neither of the entries deserve a mention, thus 4 stars.; Definitely a 5-star and particularly at the reasonable price. Dishes from Les Enfants Rouge and chef-patron Da√Ø Shinozuka. He takes classic French ingredients and adds Japanese flair. Each dish worked well with balanced, nuanced flavours that excited the palate. The rum baba is the best in the world. With one bottle of wine, the cost was just under ‚Ç¨100 a head.
The first time we came was about ten years ago. Standards have not dropped and its popularity is understandable - so book in advance. Five stars! (And the service was good too.); A must stop by place if you‚Äôre in Paris. Modern French cuisine, with a Japanese twist. Everything was absolutely delicious, and the dishes were art pieces. Very friendly staff and cozy atmosphere. Reservation recommended! Great selection of drinks including Japanese cocktails and sake üëå; Blown away by the quality of the lunch course, especially compared to the price.

Yummy and looks so pretty. We were well received and served with a smile (so important in Paris right ? üòá)
It‚Äôs a little more expensive than we thought but you get what you pay for. Around 18‚Ç¨ for a main. We shared pancakes after so it came out to about 28‚Ç¨ pp for a drink a main and a shared dessert.
Toilets clean, coffee is pretty good, I got a very original drawing on line which made me very happy !; Absolutely amazing brunch spot! We went here every day during our trip in Paris because it was so good. The staff was so kind and friendly to us, especially the server (wish we had asked her name). Highly recommend the eggs Benedict, purple pancakes, and purple french toast. If you want to avoid waiting, go on weekdays or get there when they open on weekends. We loved it!; Best impressions! Food is always delicious, my favorite place for brunch dishes in Paris! Located in the great spot as well! The service is very kind and friendly. Thank you for your always welcoming attitude and honesty.; Food was excellent! Everything that we tried was tasty. Portions were big. Staff was friendly and helpful. But it was 26 degrees outside, you can sit only inside and it was too hot.
All in all it was a very pleasant experience! Thank you!; Me and my friend had the purple french toast, which was amazing!! She already had it before and had to come back to get it.

Also the staff were so lovely and gave us great tips for Paris as a first-timer ü§ç",75004
