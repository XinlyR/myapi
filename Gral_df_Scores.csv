both deviled eggs salad and steak were 👍👍👍; felix was the best waiter!! super attentive, very funny and so kind!! made great wine recommendations and the food was phenomenal! highly recommend stopping by the family on your next trip to paris!; nice staffs, even though i don't speak french.

feeling full and no room to order dessert.

the place is gorgeous, it keeps all of its charm while being cozy. the food was very well prepared, savoury and with a nice presentation and big portions.
the waiters are professional, super nice and fast, no need to wait for the food.
great discovery!; looks can be deceiving! this restaurant boasts a high google maps rating (4.2-4.3), possibly due to its historical significance, but don't let that fool you. the food quality was a major disappointment. the french fries tasted like they'd been reheated multiple times, and the meat was simply inedible. sadly, i cannot recommend this place based on my experience.; the fastest serving of food i ever had! incredible! it tasted pretty good, and the prices were very cheap. the service is quick and efficient. one downside- other tables are very close yours - so it’s a bit “cozy”

i’d definitely recommend this place.

even though i still recommend it sooo much! it was a great experience.; this was the last restaurant we visited on our last trip to paris. i am still so grateful i chose this one. the decor was fun and very artistic. i gonna say the french knows how to make a good burger. you can see from the photo it tasted incredible so juicy and so tasty. the onion soup is also a must amazing. don’t miss out on their cheese cake because it is simply the best cheesecake i have ever had. i don’t think i can find it anywhere in australia. the staffs are super friendly and patient. overall amazing experience. the roast chicken wasn’t very warm i don’t know if this is a french thing.; overall score 8 out of 10 👍🏻

(1) locations: (9/10)
great location,,, few steps from saint honore,,, just at the corner of rue de louvre and rue coquilliére, where many bistros and brassieres are around.

(2) escargots/ snails (9/10)
it’s typical in french cuisine, but the taste from place to another is different. here they make it really good, better than many other places around the city..

(3) onion soup (10/10)
well seasoned soup, crispy on top, cheesy, and you can live the french experience very clearly… i had it in different other places, but they weren’t convincing compared to this one.. it felt more authentic besides it was so delicious.

(4) burger 🍔 (9/10)
it would be a shame if i see any score below 9… we may not like the fact they didn’t ask how we like the meat cooked (it was made medium), yet it was fresh, juicy and delicious.. one of best burgers we ever had in our travels. the pickles lifted flavors to another level.  the cheese was only part of the experience not overwhelming where the bun was soft and worked very well with their sauce and veggies they added.

(5) baguette (4/10).  served on the table..
i can’t lie, it tasted like those commercial bread you eat anywhere else in the world… it’s far from authentic french bread, at least in my opinion.

(6) service (6/10)
although they were nice, yet very slow.

we saw chickens being roasted, so we will come back for sure to try them out.; it was an excellent spot to watch the evening marathon at the olympics, they had a large tv with the basketball final on too. the staff were very friendly and attentive. prices are on the higher side, but the good was excellent.; the food here is amazing, i had medium rare steak, snails and desserts. the cheesecake is the best.

i had breakfast here and was quite disappointed.

i ordered a crepe expecting a light, delicious treat. instead, it smelled overwhelmingly like eggs—so much so that it overpowered any other flavors. the crepe had very little powdered sugar and only a small lemon wedge for garnish. i was hoping for more sugar and perhaps a lemon sugar sauce. this really affected my enjoyment and made the crepe quite unappetizing.

the coffee was okay, and the orange juice was just average.

the service wasn't great either. the wait was long, and the server seemed judgmental about my partner’s food choices.

fast service.; the atmosphere of the place is so good. the service is really efficient and kindly. the food could be better , maybe i had the wrong dish so i think i need to go again to try another one.
18 € for 3 pieces of chicken and lettuce is a bit too much..; my salad was so good with the crispy tofu. glad to know it was also gluten-free. unfortunately, the surface was not great which impacts the atmosphere.   i spent almost 15 minutes, trying to get someone’s attention and finally gave up and went inside the café where i was sitting.  8 minutes past 4 pm and they said too late i couldn’t get the little side of tofu addition.  fine, but the fact that they never came and checked on me after they delivered the food, especially before the kitchen closed - it wasn’t very busy. we are towards the end of august.    i was speaking french  though  poorly.

for our main meal. my husband ordered the duck with prunes with a side of pan fried vegetables and i had the beef fillet with pepper sauce and fries and a nice glass of bordeaux. i am not a fan of duck but this was the best duck i’ve ever tasted. i would seriously have no problem going there again and ordering that dish.

my steak was medium, as requested (glad they asked!) and i appreciated that they served the gravy without the peppercorns. i can’t tell you how many times i’ve ordered a similar dish and they filled with them. biting into them just ruins the dish for me. this sauce was so good i kept dipping my fries and bread into it. and i truly did not mind that it got into my salad!; really loved the french onion soup and snails. great food and nice place to people watch if you sit outside. the duck was slightly over cooked and the sauce’s tangy taste over powered the duck a bit and there was a lot of sauce. other than that everything else was very good!; a great place to try authentic/traditional french dishes. unfortunately, not the largest portion sizes, so either spend a lot for not a lot or go not too hungry.

very good mayonnaise; not store bought.

snails: texture of octopus, ""taste likes chicken"" - just meat innit. a novelty dish which doesn't taste bad, just tiny bits of garlic sauce smothered meat. (snails will taste similar everywhere.); very authentic place, rare food items, kind and quiet service.

your are welcomed into what a french restaurant use to look like maybe 40/50 years ago. this is your authentic french bistro of paris. you may get out of here for some very nice food such as roast pork, tartare, snails and frog legs.
but i preferred the most today : the duck with plums, and the sweetbread ( it’s an organic located around the throat of the veal that disappears during growth ) were truly moving. generous, the sauce of the duck is just a nice cuddle that enveloppes the meat and makes it juicy and moist.

true bites of pleasure.

the vue is very nice, you can see notre dame, i would rearrange the plants to have more light inside, and maybe put some old french variety. but the ambiance of the seats and the staff was welcoming. away from the craziness of some touristic spots!; very nice atmospheric place, friendly staff and quick serving times. we ordered the escargot which were delicious, however we both got steaks, pepper steak and the beef fillet with butter and ordered them medium, but they were very overcooked, not even slightly pink.

i ordered the coffee and miniatures desserts, slightly too sweet for me.

overall the vibe is lively and in a vibrant area, though nothing surprising.; i think this is one of the traditional french restaurants with a cozy decoration.
the onion soup is wonderful, the sweetness from the onion and the soup is not salty.
the mussel pot tastes brilliant. a simple way to cook lights up the freshness of the mussel.

we waited exactly 1 hour and 15 minutes from order time to delivery of our 2 burgers and 1 steak.
the only thing that came early was the kids meal and appetizer for one member of our party.
the only thing that kept us from eating our shoes were the small amount of chips and bread (with no butter or side plates) we got early on.

tables that sat after us got their food before us, when we got there it wasn't too busy, when we were done were one of the only ones left.

my theory - given service is tucked into the price, those that ordered lots of drinks and more expensive meals get fed first.

of all the places we ate while visiting in the area, never had this issue.

the ribeye- first came out rare (ordered medium) which was then fixed to well done -- was extremely fatty, chewy and lacked flavour. apple crisp  dessert lacked apples. the only redemption was the chocolate mousse and fries.; american restaurant.
nice food. mostly meat.
service was great.; i highly recommend this restaurant!

(note: à point angus beef burger pictured); i was skeptical with the reviews, but what can i say, this place makes a delicious burger. the bun is freshly made in the morning, if you get there before they open, you can see them putting the egg wash on the dough.

they don’t open exactly at noon, they opened around 12:15, but they were completely full by 12:30, so you need to be there early or line up.

burger patties are usually cooked to the more rare side in paris, so a medium is closer to a medium rare, seemingly the opposite of north america, so keep that in mind when ordering.

they definitely do not skimp on the cheese, and it overflows from the burger. taste wise, yes this is the best burger i have had in paris, so if you’re in the area and in a burger mood, come check them out.; pierre's stall, located in the marché couvert des enfants rouges, is an unstoppable burger machine. 🍔🍔🍔🍔🍔🍔

and if you have ever tried one, you know why.

here the burgers are actually perfect and it doesn't matter if you choose an angus or a chicken one.
starting from soft bun breads, everything is delicious. 😋

return of the cowboy was as not as good as this beast used to be. the bacon and crispy onion are soggy and not crunchy and the sauce was overpowering. the burger was still good but can be improved 3.5/5.

the vintage cheeseburger was amazing. buttery toasted bun to perfection! thick meat cooked medium juicy and luicy. the fillings were great and the simple mustard heavy ketchup and mayo sauce rounded this perfect creation. 5/5; delicious hamburgers and loaded fries. the oreo dunk shake is also masterful. i had the american and it was really good, and the bun was delicious. this is a nice small place with an interesting vibe, and large windows which open to the street. check it out.; pny has an atmosphere of a trendy burger place. the staff was nice but slow service. the burgers were not bad, however the bun super soft and spongey. lack of texture between the bun and the inside of the burger. got the vintage burger asked for no cheese, however still got cheese. the meat seemed flash frozen, not evenly cooked. however wasn’t bad. the salad was fun and refreshing, i enjoyed it. the chicken tenders had a good fry to them. burning man sauce definitely lived up to its name. overall not bad but doesn’t meet the price expectations.",48.86377299999999,2.3626017,0.0,True,0.0,0,75003,PNY_75003_68,False

the staff was super nice and the restaurant had a great feel and theme. the food was good but maybe not great though i think it might be a difference in the steak i grew up with vs here. basically it's chewy and has been like this at multiple places. i'm betting that france has better laws on how cattle should be treated and better for cows may not equal more tender meat.

anyway, i still loved the restaurant and would enjoy going back and trying other foods.; the brunch was quite enjoyable and priced at 35 euros. the food was delightful, and the ambiance was perfect. the restaurant wasn't overly crowded or noisy. we chose to sit outside, which was a lovely decision, making our sunday very relaxing. however, the waiting time was a tad excessive. i'm not sure of the reason, but we waited for over 30 minutes for our food to arrive; was all in all a pleasant except one of the dishes i was served gave me food poisoning and made me violently ill. i ordered sea bream carpaccio to start which did not taste fresh and scallop risotto for main which was pleasant. around 20 minutes after the meal i become very unwell and was stuck in my bed for 2 days; yes, the pictures look good but the food itself is horrible! i had so much high expectations for this place from the pictures i previously saw but ended up being disappointing. the food looks old and not fresh, tried the poulpe salad, not good, the octopus didn’t look fresh and the salad itself was not tasty. next, the fish fillet with vegetables, the fish was ok but some vegetables went bad and had to spit it out as i didn’t want to end up with a food intoxication. to finish, the creme brûlée was ok but too much sugar on top or they didn’t take the time to burn it all and ended up with big pieces of raw sugar in the mouth. the staff was lovely and the space is really nice. it’s such a waste to serve such poor quality food in such a beautiful space. i would seriously invest in finding a better chef or whoever is responsible of the menu !; went for my birthday as a surprise! and the sunday brunch was absolutely amazing - the freshest seasonal vegetables, fish, the lemon cake - oh my! i also had some white wine - chablis and tried their fois gras. everything was  excellent presented and tasted great. our waiter was very kind and spoke bothe french and english. the spot wasn't as packed as many of the other restaurants in le marais which made it even more special. and the decor is perfect for a special event.",48.8644026,2.3635674,0.0,True,0.0,0,75003,Les_75003_69,False

the food was really average/bad.
appetizer fried parmesan rice balls were ok
terrine was ok
main: beef roti salad is extremely bad: super dry beef and week old potatoes
dish of the day was fish and fish was old frozen fish
but service was really nice. the waiters were super kind.
they offered to serve another dish since i didnt touch mine and i kindly refused.
so they offered the dessert fruit salad (unfortunately it was apple sauce with canned fruits)
but appreciated the gesture for sure.
since fixe menu was quite reasonable...can't complain much
unfortunately i will not take the chance to go back...; we are a family of 5 from the us.  we went for an all-you-can-eat brunch on the weekend.  it was pretty cold out (march), so we got a table indoors, and sat next to the windows.  the decor was cozy.  the furniture was all wood, and had antiques with a farm theme.

the vibe is v. family friendly and local.  we arrived early.  the dining space filled up pretty quickly, and included a mix of families and groups of adults.  aside from us, the clientele was all locals.

the food was great.  it included a large variety of dishes, so you're sure to find something you like.  on the day we went, there was poached and smoked salmon, mussels, a couple of chicken dishes, and a large roast beef.  in addition, there were homemade country style cold-cuts, pickled vegetables, and cheese (the cheeses were great!).  there were a lot of vegetable dishes, including a potato cheese gratin that was the best i've ever had.  the kind of thing you just can't stop eating.  to round things out, there was a fresh fruit and desert table.  i had some apple tarte, a crepe and an excellent double-expresso.

we were there for an a bit more than an hour.  the staff was great, v. friendly and helpful.  the bathroom was clean.  it's too bad we only found this place at the end of our trip, we would definitely have come again.; pretty nice and the staff is super nice! kitchen was closed and the chef took extra time to make a planche mixte. thanks again.; friendly stuff, original atmosphere, but one sort of beer, i would not recommend cordon bleu and french fries. tartar is good one.",48.87266779999999,2.352248,0.076875,True,0.09375,2,75010,Laf_75010_78,True

we will definitely go back soon. 👍🏻; very good vibes, the staff recommends games and can teach them to you! we just walked in but most of the tables were full around 7-ish so making a reservation might be best. they have a ton of games (somewhere in the 800s). very glad we decided to come in when we were just walking by.

i didn't catch our main game master's name but she was super nice and gave us a great game recommendation, and found a game we were looking for based on my partner's vague memory of a game he played one time. and another guy taught us turing machine. 5/5 staff

drinks and food are both good, though we only came for drinks and dessert.

highly recommend if you like games at all (wide selection) and/or food and a good restaurant atmosphere; this was hands down the best food we had in paris, the atmosphere was great even when we were there very early. they have a short menu but plenty of options for specific diets like vegetarian or alcohol-free. afterwards we got recommended a few quick easy to understand games even for if you don't understand french very well.
we were here on a tuesday in the low season and it was booked full later on in the evening so make sure to place a reservation.

the games require a small fee per person, but you can play unlimited after that. the food and drinks are not expensive though so all in all you can't go wrong here.

the only thing i wasn't a fan of was the slightly sticky, low tables and grungy toilets. i don't think they were dirty but they can come across as a bit off putting.; great board game place with an amazing array of games. the staff are super knowledgeable about the games and give wonderful advice depending on how long you want the game to last, how many players and what kind of game you want to play. on top of all that, they have a great selection of drinks and the food was tasty and fresh. can't wait to come back again!; great place, warm and welcoming. lots of games you can play and the staff is friendly and helpful. we stumbled there by chance, it was pouring rain outside and we found this amazing joint where we spent a couple of hours drinking hot chocolate and tea and playing games. if you're in paris, don't miss it!",48.8516458,2.3468777,0.0,True,0.0,0,75005,Louf_75005_80,True

it is not something that i would recommend as a great meal if you are a good eater but to try something good and flavorful... it's not bad, we all understand the location and the price which is food nowadays but i always look for restaurants of this style to transport me for a moment to my island, but there is nothing like the generosity of one's own homeland.

very attentive staff, very clean place and great decoration.; loved everything about this place! if you’re in paris go to this place. they have an english menu for us terrible french speakers 🤣 so you know what the dishes are. we went twice while we were in paris. great sized portions with flavorful food. make sure you try the infused rum and try the pepper sauce to but be careful because it’s spicy.",48.864468,2.349519,0.0,True,0.0,0,75002,Big_75002_122,False

would recommend coming here versus other places in the city centre of paris as there are tonnes that aren’t as high quality and friendly as this place.; excelent food and service just a little bit off the notre dame cathedral.

we got the daily lunch menu - got the plates of the day together with desert and all the plates were absolutely delicious. lovely interesting salad, delicious pasta and juicy and well done steak with fries. desserts were divine as well.

i recently dined at sarde in paris, and it was a fantastic experience! the lebanese food was absolutely delicious, bursting with authentic flavors that truly transported me.

(don't miss out on their lebanese lemonade); amazing food! pure authentic lebanese  food! must must try; had an awesome meal here. the food was excellent, but the service was even better. everyone there was super friendly and made the whole experience great.

the wraps are definitely the way to go—packed with flavor. the fries were seasoned just right, and even the coffee was solid.

the food! no frills, just simple, and damn good. we ordered a veggie fried rice, chicken fried rice, and veggie fried noodles. it was much better than most else i’ve had at other “asian fusion” restaurants at double the price. the portions were also very generous.

nothing about the food i ate, impressed me to the point where i would remark about it in this review. unfortunately, i would have to say that we were disappointed. especially after reading the reviews. perhaps there may be other opportunities for an exceptional dining experience in this restaurant, but on the evening we visited, that was not to be.; a real french/paris experience. hotel made reservation when 1st choice booked. walked in and greeted by owner, host, waiter, chef. almost left as we we only people there and only one item on menus. very kind local young woman sitting outside translated for us and assured us we would not be disappointed. what as t followed was a wonderful home made(we watched her cook) meal of beet salad, broiled salmon, smashed potatoes and the best chocolate mousse zi’ve had in years. simple food prepared with skill and much better than many of the cookie cutter bistros,etc. on every block. whole bill with very good wine was less than e60! highly recommended.; came in here on a whim. service and ambiance were tremendous––felt like we were allowed to join an amazing french dinner party. tasty soup for an entree, delicious crispy fish with a sort of mashed potatoes where you could really taste the flavor of the potatoes (likely very well grown) and finished it off with a chocolate cake––i was genuinely taken aback at how good it was. also we asked for a white wine to go with the fish and it was scrumptious; stéphanie is an impeccable chef with a wonderful attention to detail! her plates are plentiful and delicious. we tried both her gateau d’aubergine and the poulet fermier. the chicken was fantastically tender. such a great restaurant. it’s like being at home, away from home. i would definitely recommend, ten times over :)

we ordered the piece de boucher grillee (butcher's grill) - which happened to be beef today, french onion soup, poached egg with mushrooms and bacon(?) and a salad.

the beef was cooked to a perfect medium rare as requested, the fries and salad provided were good.

my personal favorite are the poached egg and mushrooms. the soft mushrooms with caramelized onions were sublime.

the only thing i didn't enjoy with this place was the cigarette smoke coming in from the outside (regardless of which table), but this is largely outside the restaurant's control.

one minor feedback i have is that the salt shaker has too big holes and too much comes out at once. that shaker is probably for pepper.

nevertheless, this place gets a strong recommendation!; i had lunch today at the restaurant and found both the food and service to be very good. i just thought the portion could be a bit more generous given the price they charge. nevertheless, the food tasted really good.; . i have asked the gent, not sure if he was a waiter, if i could use the toilet, he did not understand english well, i understood, so i asked him where is your toilet... then the story, incident started. he ordered me to greet him nicely first, trying to give the non french a lesson in franch language, me saying bonne soirée before asking for using the toilet, first. once i did it and asking him for the toilet again, he started talking french only saying no toilet here, i understood. although i have experienced paris and olympics as a great event, unfortunately we ca  also find a very unfriendly examples and a shame behaviour. thanks good, this only of very view negative examples, i hope, as paris and the french are so wonderful hosts od the olympics. the response, apparently it was the owner, shows how disrespectful he is, expecting the foreigners speak his language. unfortunately, i don't speak french but it shouldn't be a reason for discrimination. such a behaviour no one should tolerate. we don't and will make sure all our friends will notice accordingly. no apologies on our end, and based on the response of the owner, we don't expect any on from him. we also do not plan to ever visit again. it is beneath of our level. just asimple message. not recommend at all.; food was a good serving size and pretty good flavours, would’ve liked a form of sauce for steak however.
everything is fairly priced and a good variety of options.
service was friendly but slightly slow as we were in a quieter section and felt somewhat forgettable. in saying that no wait was ever major and the staff member running service was super friendly and helpful.

would recommend to anyone in the area to try.; we had a very enjoyable weekday lunch here. tasty food in a classic bistro style, and considerate service. in a heavily touristy neighborhood where it’s easy to be overcharged and underwhelmed, this was a welcome find.",48.8600217,2.3471662,0.0,True,0.0,0,75001,L'Am_75001_201,False

for our main meal. my husband ordered the duck with prunes with a side of pan fried vegetables and i had the beef fillet with pepper sauce and fries and a nice glass of bordeaux. i am not a fan of duck but this was the best duck i’ve ever tasted. i would seriously have no problem going there again and ordering that dish.

my steak was medium, as requested (glad they asked!) and i appreciated that they served the gravy without the peppercorns. i can’t tell you how many times i’ve ordered a similar dish and they filled with them. biting into them just ruins the dish for me. this sauce was so good i kept dipping my fries and bread into it. and i truly did not mind that it got into my salad!; really loved the french onion soup and snails. great food and nice place to people watch if you sit outside. the duck was slightly over cooked and the sauce’s tangy taste over powered the duck a bit and there was a lot of sauce. other than that everything else was very good!; a great place to try authentic/traditional french dishes. unfortunately, not the largest portion sizes, so either spend a lot for not a lot or go not too hungry.

very good mayonnaise; not store bought.

snails: texture of octopus, ""taste likes chicken"" - just meat innit. a novelty dish which doesn't taste bad, just tiny bits of garlic sauce smothered meat. (snails will taste similar everywhere.); very authentic place, rare food items, kind and quiet service.

your are welcomed into what a french restaurant use to look like maybe 40/50 years ago. this is your authentic french bistro of paris. you may get out of here for some very nice food such as roast pork, tartare, snails and frog legs.
but i preferred the most today : the duck with plums, and the sweetbread ( it’s an organic located around the throat of the veal that disappears during growth ) were truly moving. generous, the sauce of the duck is just a nice cuddle that enveloppes the meat and makes it juicy and moist.

true bites of pleasure.

the vue is very nice, you can see notre dame, i would rearrange the plants to have more light inside, and maybe put some old french variety. but the ambiance of the seats and the staff was welcoming. away from the craziness of some touristic spots!; visited here on a saturday lunchtime in paris.

we wanted to find somewhere traditional french and a friend recommended trumilou. this was exactly the vibe that we wanted, we felt like the minority as tourists in here as most people were french which is usually a good sign.

the food was good, two of us shared the sharing steak and whilst impressive in size, frustratingly it was quite chewy and probably not how i would usually like it. the steak was very fatty and just difficult to eat (see photos).

aside that, the chips were great and the ambience / vibe lovely. would recommend this place for a traditional french lunch, but probably go for something other than the sharing steak.",48.8549403,2.3540245,0.0,True,0.0,0,75004,LeT_75004_258,False

if you're in search of a french bistro that excels in delivering amazing and delicious food, with a quick and attentive service to match, look no further than carpe diem café. it's a place that beckons you to savor every moment and every bite.; amazing food, not the nicest staff but they were busy! would visit again the food was great quality; we arrived at the happy hour, and we wanted to have a few drinks. we ordered a portion of wings, that didn't have much seasoning, and were ok.

without asking if we would want anything else, the waiter brought the bill, by explaining that they needed the table because of multiple reservations they had for the night.

a bit rude, especially when we actually wanted to stay for a few more drinks. more concerning because it didn't seem to be the case for other tables that were still ordering their drinks and food.

won't go again.; this is more of a local place with decent food and great beers on tap. we came here twice during our trip. the staff was very friendly.; visiting from the u.s and wanted to eat at a nice french style restaurant. the was the one. i enjoyed the very pleasant environment and excellent staff. the food was absolutely delicious. i had the duck and my wife had the steak. we enjoyed the vegetable dish for the appetizer. followed by an excellent dessert! fyi the chocolate mousse is all you can eat. i would recommend this place to anyone wanting a nice dinner.",48.86052670000001,2.3457876,0.0,True,0.0,0,75001,Carp_75001_303,False

chicken meatballs (4/5) - ordered for the kids but they didn't like it because it had too much parceley. overall it had a nice texture and a good sauce so we gobbled it up.
smoked haddock on cauliflower rice (1/5) - i love smoked fish but this was disappointing. the cauliflower, sauce and fish didn't work together at all and it was too salty
steak with chimichurri sauce and fries (5/5) - the best dish we got. usually ordering stake is disappointing because of the cut of meat or poor seasoning. this was perfectly cooked and seasoned and very tender - incredible!

be sure to come hungry, as the portions are generous. the complementary appetizer was intriguing, with flavors we couldn’t quite place. i highly recommend the pastilla de confit de canard – a delightful balance of sweet and savory with an interesting mix of textures. for something lighter, go for the croustillant au cantal.

the molten chocolate cake was a standout – dense, rich, and not overly sweet. the roasted apples served as a perfect palate cleanser with their slight acidity, ideal for those without a sweet tooth. the apple tart, more akin to an apple cake, was also delicious and not too sweet. lastly we also got to try the poched pear cream with chocolate – it was my favourite out of all 3 desserts!

given the reasonable prices (20€ for a menu, 5€ for a glass of wine), the generous portions, and the quality of the dishes, i highly recommend this spot!; this is a small quaint french restaurant with a chalkboard menu.  my duck was chopped up and served in a fried duck fat package with date, pistachio, and honey flavors.  served with a big green salad on the side, and a vegetable pate to dip the bread in.  dessert was a delicious warm chocolate lava cake.; back in my home country for a few days i was craving real french food. i was not disappointed. delicious generous portion and super friendly staff.

the cantal crisp brick roll with écrevisses (craifish) and scallops (coquilles st jacques) and ratatouille (the real one, not the disney one 😉) was delicious.

the cooked apple with violet liqueur, cassis (berry) sauce and chocolate sauce was perfectly balanced

for both of those, an offered peas/carrot/mint/basil dip, a glass of rose, and of course an espresso it s only 26 euros !; low-key dining room in an unassuming neighborhood. the food exceeded expectations. the duck was amazing. one of the best meals i have had.",48.8431827,2.3855205,0.0,True,0.0,1,75012,L'Al_75012_792,True

medium rare is still smth that i eat but it was unevenly fried and a half of the steak was completely raw. although i was very hungry raw is not what i can eat.

we settled on  the zucchini courgettes and tuna carpaccio.

courgettes were nearly burnt but we didn’t complain.  tuna was yummy.

my husband had the lobster roll, which, in the midst on my disaster, i forgot to taste.

i ordered the hanger steak. (bavette).

i am a meat person and love meat.

this meat smelt like it had gone bad.  i tasted it and thought it might smell bad  because it’s not wagu, but next bite and my fingers smelt like dead meat.  it tasted bitter, so i stopped eating.

i politely asked the waiter if the meat was fresh.  both he and the female said yes, and called away and didn’t ask if i am ok.

the meat was left as is and at the end, they asked if i enjoyed my non eaten meal and i replied ,no.

the waiter said he would tell chef and brought the bill.

both hubby (had an ounce), and i felt unwell that night. so disappointed with the service  and care factor zero i received.

we walked across to the dome cafe and had the yummiest milllefeux to make up for the no dinner.

apologies as i know it’s a small business. but customers do matter.; we all really enjoyed our diner at la table des copains. ceviche was great as a starter. we then all had the dorade fish as the main course. cant wait to go back and try their burger. i highly recommend.; the waiters and the chef went out of their way to accommodate all the dietary challenges of the table, and there were quite a few! they were very patient and supportive. the cooking is definitely leaning towards the “brasserie” style, but with a good degree of invention and personalization. a good experience!; thought the food was just ok, a bit expensive. didnt realize the toast appetizer would be cold. meat was great. octopus was good but not as warm as potatoes. dish lacked balance imo. service was quite nice.; disclaimer: review as italian visiting paris.
i have a mixed feeling about this restaurant. for sure a lovely, cozy atmosphere. great preparation for the dishes. of what i tried, the slow cooked meat was great, a bit less so the fried zucchini, which lacked taste, and the profiteroles, a bit odd revisitation in my opinion. service friendly but they seem understaffed so it’s hard to grab their attention. paper napkins and forcing to reuse the same cutlery between appetizers and main dishes felt a bit out of place compared to the level of preparation of the dishes.",48.8421496,2.3301888,0.0,True,0.0,0,75006,LaT_75006_877,False

and then there's shaka. hailing all the way from el salvador, he’s nothing short of a coffee alchemist. shaka's expertise in brewing is so profound, it's as if he's channeling the very essence of el salvador’s rich coffee heritage into every cup. his espresso shots are so smooth, they could make the finest italian baristas weep with envy. watching him work is like witnessing a maestro conduct a symphony; every motion is pure artistry.

the food? don’t even get me started. their pastries are baked to such perfection, it's rumored that angels descend to have breakfast here. the burgers and salads are so fresh and flavorful, they redefine what it means to eat well.

in summary, déclic café is not just a place to grab a coffee; it’s a life-altering adventure. suzette and shaka create an experience so extraordinary, it makes you believe in magic. five stars? this café deserves an entire galaxy!; pretty human and warmth place to stop for a hot wine with a slice of orange (vino navegado en chile o queimada en españa) ohhh my...in the cold winter time... plus some great creations from the kitchen for you and your family around very wild decorations and the service was fantastic...for us first timers our service was super friendly and helpfully with me poor french, it is a must stop if you are around; pub style food with many drink options. food was average, cocktails were ok. nice place to sit for a drink and watch sports.",48.8400308,2.361443,0.3635333333333333,True,0.4433333333333333,1,75005,Décl_75005_915,True

my only critique is that they add the option, and verbally emphasise, for a tip can be added when paying the bill with pre-selected options of percentages to choose from. this creates an expectation to tip, which is a practice i have only seen in tourist areas (been living in france for a decade, never seen a restaurant outside of a tourist area offer this option). however, this is totally unnecessary - tipping is not required in france as servers are paid a living wage and service is included already on the bill. if a person chooses, they leave a few euros - not 10-15% of an expensive bill. this extracts extra money from the client, who is already paying a lot for a nice meal (especially if it is a tourist who is also dealing with exchange rates!), and guilt for people who have to, in front of the server, choose no tip. for a high end restaurant, i am truly surprised at this practice given both the amount of money it represents and the ‘bad taste’ it could leave on the way out. thought about giving a lower star for this (i wish 4.5 was an option!), but i think its unfair to the rest of the experience - but wanted to note in hopes that the management reviews this unnecessary and counter-cultural practice.",48.8473045,2.3472188,0.0,True,0.0,0,75005,LaT_75005_957,False

overall it was a decent place and staff were friendly, but not the food experience you would wish from an italian restaurant.; af first, this italian restaurant looked promising. but the starter we ordered, a fried risotto mozzarella unit, was still cold and half frozen inside. instead of frying new ones, they just microwaved and served them again.

main course was okay.

for compensation of this error, we got nothing on the house or on the bill. it could have stopped me from writing this review.; dolce roma is a gem of a restaurant. everyone from the proprietor down to the bus person were friendly and offered excellent service.

the restaurant itself is well appointed, the tables aren't crowded and the decor is in excellent taste with a bright interior.

the food is excellent. i had a veal chop that was cooked rare, to perfection. the meat was juicy, nicely brown on the outside and beautifully purple on the inside.

my companions had truffle ravioli and the carbonara. both dishes were expertly cooked and the sauces were smooth, creamy and flavourful.

dolce roma is absolutely worth a visit. i highly recommend it.; cutest & coziest restaurant with a rough vibey interior, complimenting the classic italian cuisine. love the staff, who were the sweetest & the twist on tiramisu, with a tropical mango flavor to it! a must try when it comes to dessert!!",48.83402969999999,2.3533722,0.1977999999999999,True,0.2299999999999999,1,75013,Dolc_75013_1099,True

the pizzas are touted as being made with french organic wheat and spelt from local mills. while that is certainly a commendable approach to local and sustainable food sourcing, it was not specifically noticeable in the end product.

regardless, the pizzas we ordered hit the mark in any event.

the tomato sauce on the marguerite was perhaps a smidge too sweet for my palate, but overall the dish was fine. i’m also used to more basil on this particular pizza. the frome-tonne was certainly very cheesy! the restaurant provided chili oil with the pizzas, but it wasn’t especially spicy. oddly enough, they also provided a chili honey with the frometon, which, in addition to going very well with the cheeses, worked wonderfully with the from-tonne. i’d recommend asking for a side of the honey if you order this particular pizza.

we probably could have foregone the popu bread. the fleur de sel and olive oil were not very tangible in the dish and the hummus was fair to middling at the best.

despite the slight let down on the bread dish, the meal was overall a success.; i had burrata and blue cheese pizza. the pizza was unique and tasty. there were other vegetarian options, 4 other pizzas, some salads and perhaps a few others, all clearly marked on the menu.
the server was nice and friendly. i ordered a brunch size pizza and mistakenly they made a large one. i was charged the brunch sized price for the large pizza; took half back on a to-go box.; a very nice place to taste pizza with a french twist! lovely staff, great service, delicious food! the pain popu as appetizer was amazing and the burrata pizza was sooo good ! plus, don’t forget to taste their fresh juices. must try🍕; my son wanted pizza for his time paris. we just stopped at this place because of its proximity to musée rodin and we were not disappointed. the pizza was delicious and quickly served. the manager even recommended the sauce that goes quite well with the pizza.; decided to try this restaurant based on reviews i read. wow!, how can this place have good reviews for the food!  my wife and i ordered pizza that was totally tasteless. we would have had a better chance of eating the cardboard take out box. i would give -5 stars if possible. there must be a mind control device on site that implants great reviews into people’s heads as i avoided this by sitting outside!  do yourself a huge favour and do not eat here!!",48.8565341,2.3057319,0.0,True,0.0,0,75007,Popu_75007_1103,False

not practical at all!!!
to complete after answer, of course employees have the right to a lunch break, absolutely no one has said the opposite! but you should take this into account in your schedules instead of announcing continuous service when that is not the case.
all you have to do is update your google information and change a sticker on the door (rather than a post-it), just to save people from having to travel for nothing ;); overpriced scam!!!!
40% more expensive than its competitors, you read correctly 40% i did the math!
i felt really bad when i found out the true price of the items i bought!
a shame! yes to help small traders even pay a little more than usual, but 40% more expensive?!!! i saw the same items in other small parisian boutiques with the real price displayed.
it's because of stores like you that consumers prefer to order online!

edit following the store’s response:
in view of the derogatory response which looks down on its dissatisfied customers instead of questioning itself, the ""mystery"" product as you say with so much condescension is not one but two....
here are the 2 articles:
- quut medusa bath puzzle: paid €18
the average price of this item is 13€ (we also find it cheaper and the maximum that i have seen is 14€90, except at your place...18€)
- quut hoppi dino garden green jumping ball: paid 65€ and all the prices i have seen are 49.95€ or 49.99€ at your competitors

i bought because i wanted to please my nephews as i don't have children myself. i'm not aware of prices, i think a lot of people are in my situation, when you love you don't count.. if it's the price, that's how it is, on the other hand this feeling of having been cheated after knowing the prices charged in other stores is very unpleasant and i would like to warn all your potential customers.
i even add to my comment that for this price we could expect incredible service, but i asked for gift wrap which was made very roughly, so i did it again... it's a detail but at least everything is said!; children's paradise: toys, decoration, clothes, stuffed animals (all soft and very original, i actually fell for one of them!!!l, accessories, perfect when you're looking for a gift for a little bit!",48.86477,2.3478335,0.0668385416666666,True,0.0815104166666666,2,75002,Nots_75002_1143,True

they must’ve changed up their menu because out of all the dishes, only two were good - the duck speck and the dessert. let me review each course one by one:
1. appetizers - tapioca chips with radish cream, carrot cake roll, and pork lard with bread - none of these stood out and lacked complexity in flavor and texture
2. appetizers 2 - egg yolk - this is quite unique and tasted decent
3. appetizer 3 - parmesan puff with mushroom mayo and beet root with horseradish - this was okay for me
4. course 1 - crab filling dumpling with chicken stock - this was interesting in a bad way. with the stock the bottom became soggy very quickly, the flavor was quite mild
5. course 2 - duck speck - this was unique and delicious, i liked how it was presented, and the pickled onion really balances things out
6. course 3 - pasta with almond filling and veal broth - this was okay, again flavor is super mild
7. course 4 - fish sausage - by far the worst dish of the night. the sausage was extremely mushy and lacked any complexity in flavor. for the main protein this is a major disappointment and felt like they’re being cheap
8. course 5 - dessert - this was delicious, i liked how it seems like a heavy dessert but the ice cream and other parts actually made it less heavy

service also leaves a lot to be desired - after we finished dessert and informed the waitress that we don’t need coffee or tea, she left us there for 20 minutes without bringing the bill or checking in on us. we had to try to catch her and ask for the bill. when i put down my credit card, she still gave the receipt to my fiance to sign even though she saw me taking it out of my wallet; absolutely outstanding! so glad i stumbled on to this place for ma food blog review. it’s off the beaten path in a small and cozy little space. francesca made us feel so welcome!
the food was delicious.; beautiful restaurant, incredible food, and excellent service. a hidden gem of paris. dog friendly!; one of a perfect dinners in my life
a bit expensive but, it's worth to pay for it!

the mood was quiet and cozy
server was so kind and nice
and all foods were so great!

it's italian in french but i became to go italy to have dinners like this

i started with a starter of vegi chip/prendang/bread and a cooked egg (it was cooked inside but looked rare outside but was so nice and creamy with truffle sauce)

then another breas with olive oil
beans with cream and crunch
another breads
cabbage with cabbage sauce
gnocchi with vegi chip
duck with cooked potato (i couldn't take a pictur of potato but with was so soft and tasty)
vanilla sauce and bread

the last sweets was the greatest
kakao chip and cream, and there was strawberry sorbet inside!

enjoy perfect italian in france; absolutely the best meal of our trip to paris and maybe in my lifetime! the ambiance, service, food presentation and flavors were all outstanding.",48.8473756,2.3470943,0.0,True,0.0,0,75005,Cias_75005_1199,False

we decided to get a main dish and two appetizers and see how it goes. meanwhile, the dishes at tables around us didn’t look like anything especial and a bit plain, so i was getting worried and was looking for the next restaurant to go after to get “more proper”food.

once they brought our food, it was a turning point. as simple as it looked, it was all made to perfection and absolutely delicious. to the point that i decided to stay longer and have dessert. i’m so glad that we did. it was spectacular. again, super simple green apple tart (or more like a green apple upside down), but wow.  i never had apple tart this good and i’m not an apple dessert person.

i’ll be back and hopefully can get a table again. well done. 👍

ps: the chateaubriand steak with potato gratin is an absolute must have.; everything you want from a paris bistrot - not too big, relaxing atmosphere, excellent food featuring many classics, a good but not pretentious wine list. extremely friendly and helpful service. we went on a quiet sunday so it was a little quiet, but i'm sure on a busier day it would have a little more bustle.; recommendations: get the lamb dish and the gratin potatoes side. the tart was lovely for dessert.

the good: the place is nice and staff is very polite. the dishes are a fairly good size and quality.

the not too good: it's a bit expensive for what it is. specially the starters. location is the reason so no big deal. you can enjoy a nice meal here.

here's the menu:; 🍽food -  4 of  5 i ordered beef with bean, which was well done with great sauce. foe deserve i ordered tarte which was ok. i didn't ordered champagne but they accidentally served me one which was so good but didn't know that it was 18€!!!

we even had three desserts because we couldn’t decide and all three were delicious! we spent under €100 and that got us both two glasses of wine, a bottle of still water, a starter, main and dessert each, plus another dessert as mentioned!
simply incredible.
also upon ordering wine i’m not expert and the waiter helped me decide. he suggested a red and it was absolutely delicious! they then also wrote it down so i could buy it when i get home.
we would highly recommend it and we would happily return over and over again. we will be suggesting to our friends who visit paris.

during our 6 days stay in paris bistrot le poincaré happened to be just a few blocks away from our airbnb. one day we stopped there for dinner and liked it so much that came back for lunch on the last day just before going to the airport :)
both times we sat outside, watching passers-by. the service was quick and super friendly.

during our visit to paris we didn't go to upscale/fine dining/michelin restaurants but ate at bistros and cafes similar to bistrot le poincaré. hands down bistrot le poincaré had the best food we tasted in paris! it was very fresh and absolutely delicious on both occasions! presentation was also great like a piece of art! i wish i can visit this place again someday.

we highly recommend bistrot le poincaré if you are in the area!

dishes ordered

avocado toast with smoked salmon, beetroot caviar, feta cheese and egg yolk - this looked beautifully and tasted deliciously!
tuna tataki - this looked beautifully and tasted deliciously!
duck breast orange-flavored honey sauce, spelt risotto with asparagus - duck breast was a bit tough, but very flavorful. risotto was as good as the duck.
beef tartare with herring caviar, smoked oil - excellent. could get a bit more spices imo.
poultry suprême stuffed with truffle and baby spinach with slow-braised baby potatoes - delicious
slow-braised baby potatoes - excellent
chicken burger - good
sea bass fillet, white butter sauce with saffron - delicious!
strawberry pavlova	- perfect
crepe with caramel - excellent french crepe. it was a great last note to part with paris on :); we wanted to try some typical french food, and this was my daughter’s recommendation, and it didn’t disappoint. the food was delicious, and the service was excellent. it’s a little pricier than some places, but you get what you pay for. remember not to order your steak well-done; i said it jokingly, and he gave me a strange look. 😂😂 i do like it medium-rare anyway. take my daughter’s recommendation; it’s worth the money.",48.8651485,2.2866662,0.4158,True,0.4949999999999999,1,75016,Bist_75016_1234,True

the place has an underground floor as well.; it was an interesting experience. we got curry sauce with our grilled mexican chicken and an unknown sauce with the crispy chicken. we had  virgin drinks as the only alcohol option was beer. the salad was good,  the saving grace.  i don't think we'll be back. the service was average, and there's lots of other places to try.; this cozy restaurant has left the best impressions! hospitable hosts, delicious dishes, beautiful presentation.
one of the best beef burger i eat in my life the meat is amazing

i recommend to everyone! i would like to come back here again and again.; went to paris for the first time, visited this restaurant and i was impressed, the food came quite fast. the fries were double fried so crunchy but the avocado burger was the star of my dish. nice flavours, combination of the veggies chosen in combination with the medium cooked beef burger, i took my first bite of heaven since this burger just melts into your mouth, loved it 10 outta 10, definitely recommend!!; we did a search for late night kitchens and found this place. it appeared to have good ratings, so we rushed over in a heavy rain storm. when we arrived, i saw a gentleman delivering a plate to a couple sitting at an outside table. when my family attempted to place an order, we were told we could only place an order to go. i offered to pay extra to be able to sit down in the otherwise empty restaurant and avoid the thunderstorm. i once again was told no even though the restaurant was listed as being open for another 30 minutes and i had just witnessed him serve a couple. i’m not sure if this man was a manager or owner, but he was extremely rude, unprofessional, and unwelcoming. i was very hungry, so i ordered, but my family was so offended by his behavior that they refused to order anything. the only difference between my family and the couple who was receiving friendly service was they were muslim and we are american. the man appeared to be of similar background to the muslim couple and was very friendly and allowed them to sit and enjoy their food. i believe we were victims of blatant discrimination. all customers should be treated fairly regardless of religion, ethnicity, or nationality. his behavior is totally unacceptable. we are here for the olympics as are thousands of other non-muslim americans. we all should be treated kindly. in addition to the discrimination, we had some serious issues with the food. i ordered a cheeseburger and it was burned. i couldn’t finish it because every bite tasted like burned bread. the fries were soggy and unseasoned. my salad was flavorless. i could only eat a few bites of the cheeseburger and the rest went into the trash. i could have at least enjoyed the food if i was going to be forced to endure blatant discrimination. it’s zero stars for me.",48.8715366,2.3073435,0.1018333333333333,True,0.1083333333333333,3,75008,The_75008_1235,True

the food was fantastic, customised to our requests (putting things on the side, avoiding dairy/egg contact, beef cooking levels), and served at the same time with attention and purpose from the staff. plates were in the sub 20 euro range, very reasonable portions and well prepared. it is only steps away from trocadero and because it is 1-2 blocks up from the main roundabout, prices were 10 euro cheaper per plate.

the beef tartare was excellent, well-mixed, and served at a lightly cool temperature, served with salad and fries. duck confit and rump steak both cooked perfectly.

great for families as we didn’t want to be overly pampered from eager wait staff, nor rushed out and didn’t want to pay too much.

the only downside is that the cigarette smoke from the customers sitting outside kept blowing inside towards us. but that is a paris-wide cafe issue.

highly recommended and would love to visit again.; stopped by for drinks and dessert.  it was divine.  great little spot and not overrun with tourists.  appreciated the diverse menu but stuck with crème brûlée.  it was really good, paired with a nice beverage and wonderful people watching (dog watching too 😊).; excellent food and service. i had the special of the day, sausage with cheesy mash. didn’t look amazing but tasted unbelievable. delicious soup, mozzarella sticks, steak, salad and burger too, finished with a generous serving of crepe. definitely recommend.; we had salmon and a burger. they accommodated gluten free. we had a wonderfull fresh fig desert with ice cream. a nice atmosphere in a pub.",48.8660736,2.2859887,0.0,True,0.0,0,75016,Duca_75016_1253,False

very pricy for what it is. you pay for the location and all the waiters running around. some were friendly but the one who took our order was rude.

we ordered mussels with chablis wine (i’m from the chablis area,, very good wine), couldn’t taste the wine at all, you find better in cheaper restaurants.
got the salmon with spinach, good but pricy, nothing extraordinary about it.
got a goat cheese salad for the appetizer, no real taste to it, had to add pepper on each bite so it would taste like something and asked for olive oil to also add some taste to it, the oil barely tasted like olives.

originally wanted the veal dish but the rude waiter simply and rudely said i don’t have that.
got a steak with pepper sauce instead, i asked for it very well done, it was cut in the middle to cook it well i’m guessing but even with that it was pink inside. very well done means very cooked. it doesn’t matter if you don’t eat your meat like that or it’s sacrilege for the cook, i’m the one who will eat it. and for 45€ steak with fries you can’t cook it well done without opening it in the middle or even opened for that matter ?!?! you should be able to cook a thick steak very well done for the price and that kind of establishment.
the pepper sauce didn’t have any pepper taste to it.

we will never go back to pay over priced food. food is not bad it’s just the overall experience and again  very pricy.; we had a great time. we were running late, but they held our table. the veal was amazing. try the fresh seafood platter with raw oysters.; this is one of paris most authentic restaurants (of course a little touristy) but perfect to get the full on experience. the escargots were amazing, same as the steak and frites. good atmosphere, beautiful decor and very relaxed setting!
thumbs up!; our service was perfect and the meal was absolutely delicious. i had sea bass and my daughter had salmon tartar. the parisian onion soup was likely the best i’ve ever had. my daughter experienced her first ever escargot here and she admitted she loved the flavor it had an earthiness that was brought out by the herbs, garlic, and butter. for dessert my daughter ordered crepes flambé and she was able to watch as our server prepared it which delighted her. thank you so much for the experience and we look forward to dining with you again in october.; the food is excellent especially the seafood. the service is great and friendly! appreciate the hospitality and if there is a bathroom at downstairs that would be perfect!",48.8711033,2.33364,0.0,True,0.0,0,75009,Gran_75009_1261,False

was very disappointed with the meal. the burger wasn't the hottest to start with, the bap tasted uncooked and yeast like. (toasted would have been better) the meat was pretty tasteless no salt and pepper. the chips, some were hot, warm, cold, and even a burnt one. so if they were fried fresh to order all should be the same. sadly i can't recommend it.; its okay, when it comes to the smash burger, at first the cheese hits you with a nice flavor (or not) as it tastes unique, then the rest is your typical burger that you might have tasted much better elsewhere.
staff are friendly.
atmosphere isn’t the best, tables not the cleanest, and the general decoration gives off a weird ikea like shop-work shop vibe which does not make sense and add anything to the dining experience.
summary, not impressed nor am i bothered by the experience, simply doubt i would visit again.
can be a good option for budget travelers however.; great little burger place we came across while walking to the sights. the staff was very jovial and the service was fast. the food was solid, not mind blowing but defiantly solid. they had this homemade ketchup i’m assuming as it was in a self labeled jar but wherever they got it, that stuff was on point. the fries were coated with paprika which was new to me but defiantly tasty.; super friendly staff with a great french concept. the ""hamburgés"" are very good and fries aswell. just a little bit cold hence the 4 stars. their own soda is great!",48.8427854,2.3265324,0.0,True,0.0,0,75014,Big_75014_1284,False

firstly, i need to say the burger came to my table in less than 10 minutes—the service was impressively fast! the taste of the burger was good, and i enjoyed it. the chips were normal, nothing particularly special.

they provided a bottle of water with my meal, which was a nice touch, but it didn’t add much to the overall experience. however, they forgot to give me some napkins, but that wasn’t a big problem.

overall, i enjoyed my visit, and i think birdy burger is a good option for a quick takeaway.; if you want a classic american styled cheeseburger in paris, this is it.

portions were generous and everything about the burger was done to perfection.

and oh yes, don’t forget to order the peanut butter milkshake.; take away cheeseburger with sweet potato fries. had to wait about thirty minutes as they were busy. but oh my gosh, what a burger. well worth the wait. chips were ok, but burger was out of this world. highly recommend.; amazing experience at birdy! when you go for a fast food you expect a basic service but the veggie burger was absolutely amazing. very great burgers, great service, super fun team! great food i will come back any time i’m in paris! +1 for the milkshake; very friendly service from the staff at birdy.
they welcomed me very warmly and explained their concept and different type of burgers.

the burger and fries were good but nothing out of the common. i ordered the yankee and it was ok.

i feel prices are extremely high for the size and type of the hamburger’s.

, we were greeted so warmly and felt immediately welcome. like having a meal with a long lost friend. the owner is joyful and friendly and has the best interactions with all of the guests. our waitress was phenomenal; she explained the menu in english for us and was incredibly kind. we loved everything!! from the smoothie watermelon mint mocktail, to the cns burger with special sauce, the keftah wrap and the cheddar sauce on the fries! all of the flavors were so well thought out and were a wonderful medley of flavors. get the cheese sauce on the fries, you won’t regret it. and if you have room, save it for dessert! we enjoyed the biscotti sauce with the pita; what a combo. thank you “mille merci” for our most memorable and enjoyable experience in all of our paris dining. ♥️♥️♥️; eat n’ saj here is my new favorite thing to do in paris. from the moment we walked in, we knew this would be a special place.

we were warmly welcomed into the restaurant by the host, who we learned owned this place with his family (brother and mother). when i say it was a warm welcome, i mean it felt like we’d known each other for a long time and i was coming to dinner at their home.

he went through the menu options with us in english, offered suggestions and took our order of taouk (chicken) saj, fattoush salad, 2x falafel, and hummus. look at this photo of the hummus as an example of how much love this family puts into their restaurant and their patrons. they make sure you feel comfortable.

and the food did not disappoint. it was likely the best saj i’ve ever had - even compared to the options i’ve had at home. the chicken was tender and the composition of herbs and sauce were both cooling and deeply flavorful. the falafel was equally special, with a small tomato at the base, making each bite refreshing and a little more moist. the fattoush salad, though they used an iceberg lettuce that fell a bit flat in flavor, did not disappoint overall. the hummus was also great.

before we left, they offered dessert, and we ordered the baklava, though we don’t often leave room. i’m glad we did this time because it was the flakiest, most flavorful i’ve ever tasted. though not made in house, it’s made by a local baker and delivered fresh every day. i can’t believe how good these were. he even sent us home with 2 just because i said they were delicious.

i can’t wait to tell all my friends who visit paris that a meal at cook’n saj feels like a warm hug from a friend you haven’t seen in a long time.",48.8531098,2.3320746,0.528,True,0.55,2,75006,Cook_75006_1361,True

the atmosphere of the restaurant is warm and welcoming, with beautiful middle eastern decor that immediately transports you to another world. as soon as i walked in, i was greeted by the friendly staff who made me feel right at home.

now, let's talk about the food. the menu at al karam is full of traditional lebanese dishes, and each one is prepared with care and attention to detail. i started with some of the appetizers, including the hummus and baba ghanoush, both of which were rich and flavorful. the pita bread was warm and fresh, and the perfect complement to the dips.

for my main course, i opted for the shish taouk, which is marinated chicken skewers. the chicken was tender and juicy, with a perfect balance of spices. it was served with a side of rice pilaf and a fresh salad that was bursting with flavor.

to top it all off, i ordered the baklava for dessert. the pastry was flaky and sweet, with just the right amount of honey syrup.

overall, i highly recommend al karam to anyone looking for an authentic lebanese dining experience. the food is outstanding, the atmosphere is cozy and welcoming, and the service is top-notch. this is the perfect spot for a romantic date night or a fun night out with friends. don't hesitate to make a reservation – you won't be disappointed",48.8384507,2.2971178,0.0,True,0.0,0,75015,AlKa_75015_1364,False

i ordered lasagna and a creme brulee. had the shock realising that the lasagna had a strong curry taste (a legit italian would get a heart attack hearing of this). italian cuisine does not, under any form, use curry in any of its dishes. this is for certain not an italian dish.
the creme brulee was fine.
the place was rather cold, there wasn't any heating available.; 🍝 great food, average service 🇫🇷
we had some absolutely amazing food here. my spaghetti bolognas was so saucy and delicious and my fiancés calzone was huge.
however the service could definitely do better. whether they were all just flustered or there wasn’t enough of them, after seated we were left for about 15-20 mins without a menu. we had to ask and then once we had decided what we wanted had to wait a further 20 mins just to be serves. but once the ball got rolling the rest fell into place.
all-in-all, great food at affordable prices, which is a lot to ask when in the vicinity of the eiffel tower.; when you think about eating out in a capital city you expect that prices will be high but gusto italia is a parisian delight.

located near the eiffel tower, this delightful italian bistro might be small in size but it is huge in character, ambiance and service.

we just wanted a small lunch and went for the margarita pizza to share between the three of us. we were greeted with a free grilled vegetable appetiser and a bottle of chilled water for the table while we waited for the pizza to arrive.

when it did, it was extremely nice. the fresh, hand pulled base was beautiful and baked to perfection. the ragu and cheese complimented the base, making this an excellent margarita. i wish we could have tried some of the other pizzas on offer but my 9 year old son just likes the plain cheese but he did say it was one of the best he’d had.

all of this for just €10, in paris! if you are in the french capital seeing the eiffel tower, this is the place to go.",48.8563273,2.3026114,0.0,True,0.0,0,75007,Gust_75007_1376,False

i’ve seen dishes on other tables and they didn’t look good either. waiters very rude and unfriendly.
avoid this place, it is really bad.; i had a perfect lunch there a few days ago. very good food (avocado and tuna as a starter, then bavette ), kind and professional waiter. i ll definitely go back soon.; the food here is hands down amazing. they have amazing french cuisine.
the waiters however are a bit rowdy but they were pretty helpful in helping us translate the menu to english.

i recommend.; went without reservation on a week night and was seated correctly. food was really good, the pizza was a bit hard to cut. the escalope was perfect and the burrata was good; food was excellent, service was also great. i just gave 4 stars as they took us to an empty table (not made up) and didn’t give us any menus which meant we could only look at our phones until they eventually made their way over. would highly recommend though! great veggie options!; the food was excellent, in fact ironically this italian restaurant was the best food of our trip to france so far, and we do love french cuisine. the ingredients on our appetizer cold plate were very fresh, delicious with no added seasoning other than a touch of olive oil. our paste was cooked perfectly not too soft, and the sauces exploded with flavor. the truffle flavor in the tortellini was just perfect, enough to bring an obvious flavor but not too strong that it overpowered the mushrooms and cream, simply ideal.; lovely neighbourhood italian joint.

went on a sunday evening around 7.45pm without a reservation and got the last available table it seemed.

service was fast (maybe even too fast) but super friendly and efficient. we had the milanese (breaded and fried veal cutlet) which came with simple tomato pasta (is that traditional? felt a bit odd but fine).

we also had the outstanding and star dish that was the truffle ravioli - despite a cream sauce, was not at all heavy and didn't rely only on truffle oil as it came generously shaved with the fresh truffle.

the tiramisu was a perfect desert as it always is when serviced without any changes to the old classic recipe.

food was okay, but far from perfect

atmosphere is good, especially on the street seats; i was clearly disappointed by the unfriendly welcome at the place to be... wagram. the service was cold, lacking any explanation of the venue; i didn't feel welcomed at all. however, the decor is nicely done, creating a cozy atmosphere where one can comfortably work. i opted for the tartare, a parisian brasserie classic, which was good. yet, the lack of hospitality leaves much to be desired. it's a shame because with a warmer welcome, this could be a great spot. a smile costs nothing. 😕🍽️🏨; i really enjoyed working at the place to.
the place is suitable for working in peace and quiet and it's very well set up in terms of coworking space. you can stay there as long as you want and you are not really bothered.
i find that the prices are relatively expensive (but that's normal given the neighbourhood) and it's rather justified given that there is no ""package"" like some coworking spaces offer in paris. so you have to play the game! the coffee is excellent and the staff are charming and always available. i didn't have to raise my hand for the waiter to come and give me the instructions for the wifi.
one small comment about the wifi: you will have to reconnect via the gate very often and it's a bit inconvenient if you're in a meeting. i hope it was just punctual.
great decor, the music is very discreet in the background compared to starbucks for example.
the food menu is really varied and i highly recommend the vegetarian burger (which i ordered about 2 years ago)

please, save your money and go somewhere else!; i only post if i feel passionately about a place.   well this place is just waw!! my best friend and i visited paris for the first time in april and wanted an exceptional food experience. we planned our trip for months and finally were in paris.  i am so happy i agreed with her after she said the photos of the food looked incredible. we walked in and at first i wasn't sure they would serve us because we did not have a reservation but when the gentleman greeted us it seemed that we could stay.

the atmosphere was comfortable and modern and the service from the restaurant team was attentive and comforting.   from selecting the wine to dishes we were blown away by the quality and taste.  it is quaint and a place you feel special.

i've experienced some of the best italian food in san diego such as il fornaio and enoteca buona forchetta but la famiglia in paris left me speechless.

if you want fine dining that is luxurious and most importantly the best food this is the place to visit.   a hidden gem of paris, tres bien!!; if you find yourself wandering the charming streets of paris, craving a taste of home amidst the plethora of restaurant options, look no further. nestled in the heart of the city, this culinary gem provided us with an unforgettable dining experience that truly felt like a warm embrace.

as we step in the restaurant at first we were clueless of should we sit or wait for someone as we didn't find any server for 5mins, but as soon as the staff saw us they greeted us with smiles that immediately made us feel at ease.

let's talk about the food – oh, the food! every bite was a symphony of flavors that danced on our palates, leaving us utterly enchanted. as travelers accustomed to sampling various cuisines, it's rare to find a meal that truly resonates with the comfort of home. yet, each dish at la famiglia exuded that unmistakable sense of familiarity and nostalgia, transporting us to a culinary haven where every bite felt like a warm embrace.

whether it was the perfectly seasoned cod, the indulgent pasta dish, or the decadent dessert that left us weak in the knees, every aspect of the menu was a testament to the chef's skill and dedication to excellence. each dish was crafted with care and attention to detail, resulting in a dining experience that surpassed our wildest expectations.",48.8796477,2.2865202,0.1298958333333333,True,0.1510416666666666,2,75017,LaF_75017_1484,True

the atmosphere was nice, and the service was okay, but the unexpected charge for water, on top of already average food, made the experience disappointing. i think there are better italian spots in the city.; been here thee times so far.

breakfast: the croissants were warm and absolutely delicious!!

dinner: we took starters and main course, which were delicious as well.
we came back a third time just for the amazing starters!

the service was a little depending on who you got. some of the waiters were just ok, one was a little grumpy, and others were fantastic!
the third time we got an adorable waitress how gave us the best energy and experience.

would definitely come back.; we were in a hurry and had a simple menu order of pizza, mojito and cappuccino. very fast order fulfilment. and i must say pizza was exceptionally good !! good service too.; papilla is wonderful! everything we had was delicious and the vibe is on point. everyone that works at papilla are so welcoming and delightful.

the staff at fuxia were incredibly helpful in assisting us with selecting our dishes. their knowledge and recommendations made the decision-making process easy and enjoyable. the service provided was professional, with attentive staff ensuring that our needs were met throughout the meal.

i highly recommend fuxia for anyone looking to indulge in a delightful meal near the iconic arc de triomphe in paris.; great food - make sure you go there hungry because portions are quite huge. my friend had a pizza (the crust was a bit soft but the cheese tasty) and the fried mozzarella sticks with pesto, and i had the polenta (absolutely delicious!), a portion of bresaola and a side of veggies (very good, quite oily though). overall, tasty food, nice atmosphere and kind staff. would recommend !
they now have an english menu too :); ""fuxia"" serves the best pizza i've ever tried, and i highly recommend their nduja pizza. the perfect combination of flavors, coupled with attentive and friendly staff, creates a delightful dining experience. the inviting interior adds to the overall charm, making fuxia a must-visit for pizza enthusiasts seeking a memorable culinary adventure.""",48.8783189,2.2844202,0.0,True,0.0,0,75017,Fuxi_75017_1564,False

i and 3 other friends asked three times if it’s possible to sit at a table outside since the weather was nice and we saw some guests were also sitting there, but the waitress and waiter refused us and said they closed the terraces. so okay we understood and sat inside where we were designated to sit. then what??? 5 minutes later, they allows 2 or 3 groups of guests sitting outside?? reallyy!!

we tried to ask why? the waitress used her worst attitude and communication to explain that they just closed that area for 10 minutes! now they opened again. really? even the guys who welcomed us, not friendly at all.

i wish she could have proposed or asked us again if we would like to sit there when they opened again, i could understand. but no!

the duck was cooked perfectly and the hint of honey in the sauce was very tasty. the potatoes were crispy and soft but not salted but they give you salt on the table so that was good. the green beans were garlicky which was great because i love garlic but again not salted. overall i loved this dish. the portion was so filling too but one critique is that it came out pretty quick after i made the order and wasn’t very warm.; nice location on a corner in monmarte, so great for people watching.  last dinner for us in paris and was disappointed by the quality of the escargot, which i'd had at several other spot in france.  not enough garlic butter by far!  my husband's portion of salmon was very small but an abundance of potatoes.",48.8840181,2.3391494,0.0,True,0.0,0,75018,LeR_75018_1620,False

there was another red flag when a couple entered, sat, and suddenly just left, we had already ordered. otherwise, we had the same feeling as not the best place to be..
we ordered the oysters, smocked salmon with toasted bread and butter to share, and creme broule. and 2 glassed of chardonnay.
we only enjoyed the oysters. we were disappointed by the salmon, which was like a packed supermarket slice of salmon, with dry old bread 😕 and a slice of lemon, with the label on ( therefore not even washed)
i can't believe how we spent 61€ on this dinner, which we could have had in the hotel room from the supermarket at the corner...

the ambiance was absolutely magical, with the gentle motion of the water and the twinkling parisian lights setting the perfect romantic tone. cruising past the eiffel tower, beautifully lit up against the night sky, made the evening even more enchanting. it was truly a night to remember.; excellent boat trip and value for money.
i reviewed several others before booking & this company is one of the few who offer a dining menu that matches with the atmosphere - a 1st class restaurant.
upholstered dining chairs, upbeat background music & food that not only looks exquisite but tastes good too!

everyone on the boat had window seats and the opportunity to go onto the roof of the boat & take panoramic parisien views!

nothing was rushed and we thoroughly enjoyed it our trip.; overall it was a good dinner experience. the waiter we had was friendly and tried to hustle as fast as he could, but there were numerous large tables he was helping out with. the views were spectacular and watching the sunset.
the only complaint we would have is the photographer lady on board took our photo in front of the eiffel tower while passing it and cut half of the tower off in the pic. now you should know better as a photographer to capture the entire structure. duh. when she brought us the printouts for purchase, we nicely requested a retake. she had the audacity to go complain to the manager right by us and then ignore us the rest of the cruise. we would have gladly bought all images if she would have just retaken the one image. i would recommend they hire a new photographer.
food was small portions but enough to fill you up. desserts were delicious, also.; booked a sunset dinner cruise on the river seine and highly recommend! we celebrated our 25th anniversary, it was a memorable night. everything from the boarding crew to the host plus waitress/staff was excellent. they made sure this was a special night for us. food was excellent, they even added a bonus wine bottle! first time visiting paris and we will definitely be back!; the food was good, but the service was wonderful and the atmosphere was perfect. all the staff were so welcoming. we were served by jewel and he was very kind, switching between french and english whenever necessary. this definitely provides value for money, the cruise is long and you don't feel any need to rush the meal. i recommend to anyone who wishes to have a beautiful dinner cruise along the seine!",48.855056,2.2869361,0.0,True,0.0,0,75015,LeC_75015_1634,False

4 for the atmosphere just because kitchen too close to the tables, and no barrier in between. smog penetrated into the common space. will be better to set up at least glass barrier.; nice little bistro restaurant. small but good balanced menu. some vegetarian dishes, good cheese choice. the staff is exceptionally friendly and they do speak as well english. we were 4 and paid 100€ food and drinks. very good value in paris. we reserved an hour before arrival a table through their website. worked without problems.recommended; my favorite bistro in the neighborhood! the food is excellent (make sure to try the chocolate fondant), and the space is cozy and charming. it's also a great place for an evening drink.
the owner's and staff's personalities really bring the magic. if it's not too busy you might have a nice chat with pauline herself or with some of the many regulars.
i particularly recommend tuesday nights for casual jazz sessions. make sure to reserve as it can fill up quickly!",48.89266,2.335356,0.0,True,0.0,0,75018,LeB_75018_1696,False

(don't miss out on their lebanese lemonade); amazing food! pure authentic lebanese  food! must must try; i recently checked out sarde in paris, and i really enjoyed it! the atmosphere was warm and inviting, and the staff were super friendly. i had the sarde chicken wrap, which was juicy and full of flavor. the falafel was crispy and delicious, and the manouche zaatar was fresh and tasty. overall, sarde is a great spot for mediterranean food, and i'd definitely go back.; had an awesome meal here. the food was excellent, but the service was even better. everyone there was super friendly and made the whole experience great.

the wraps are definitely the way to go—packed with flavor. the fries were seasoned just right, and even the coffee was solid.

worst experience in my life so far.; this place was still serving breakfast after i woke up extremely late and i was so grateful for that!

very reasonable pricing as well.

the beef stew provençal was the clear favorite in our table and was quickly devoured by adults and kids (probably should’ve ordered one more). i personally loved the fillet au poivre, perfectly cooked steak bathed in a rich pepper sauce. the asparagus ravioli was a surprise, never had asparagus come off so strong (in a good way) and the hazelnuts complemented them perfectly. the chicken with oyster mushrooms in jus was great too, i couldn’t stop eating the mushrooms. i had a bite of the strawberry in chantilly cream before the kiddos made quick work out of the dessert.

for the umami matcha you can choose white or dark chocolate, but they recommend the white. the drink was nice and smooth and just a little sweet from the chocolate, which is perfect. but for me the matcha flavour was a little too hidden, it could have been a little stronger.

will definitely go back; highly recommended, great authentic french cuisine.

this is a historical place with truly french food and not a single «imported» dish - you don’t see burgers or fish-and-chips here. i respect that, as there is a whole proper french menu to try here!

had several great lunches here, taking the fish plats du jour (daily menu).

everything was top-notch, lovely service and atmosphere, and overall great food.

to the owner:
the salade de chèvre chaud was pretty sad - 3 very small pieces of cheese on pieces of toasted bread, with pretty tired greens. i would recommend iterating on this recipe 🙏; service with a smile and incredible food.

this is my second time here within a year, and both times were great.

service is friendly, quick, professional and knowledgeable. the food is gorgeous and very reasonably priced. we ordered the steak and it was delicious. the serving was very big and i was unable to finish it. the starter of snails was amazing and the red wine was perfect.

i would highly recommend this restaurant, and i will definitely come again next time i am back in the area.; thank you for the really great dinner tonight at your restaurant 😍! we had chilled asparagus soup and tatar as well as steak! it was perfectly cooked and i am still amazed about the soup.

first impression at the door was horrible, security guy seemingly forgot that it’s not a nightclub. once in you need to pay in advance, then if you want something extra (second glass of juice etc) you need to pay again on the spot. that seems redundant.

staff is nice and welcoming, food was great and lots of different foods were available. strong point: entertainment for children is available and included and they’re supervised.

the building is aging and many things are neglected it seems (toilet seat broken, doors to electrical safety equipment left open, spiderwebs everywhere and some chairs visibly not in good condition - also some „black mystery dust“ on the napkins). parking is difficult on the weekends due to the closure of the park, toilets are not stroller - wheelchair accessible.

for the price it must be better i think, the food can only make up for so much and then some.; beautiful park area. the building is a little need of some upkeep. i went to attend a new years eve event. the meal was just ok, and the service quite slow, even by relaxed paris standards. i noted that a large group seated almost 30 minutes after me were served their full course first. they may have been thinly staffed that night, but it seemed off.; a very scenic spot to host any event. the fees for depositing is slightly elevated but overall the service is on par.; very lame club! we were here at silvester party. first of all the bouncers were so unprofessional and unfriendly that i would gove them a minus -10.
they pushed my friend as if he were a garbage bag while checking him. even though we had biught tickets in advance for about 50€/person - they wanted to froce us to buy bottles so they can let us in. after i complained and showed them their website, another bouncer came and told them that i am right and the were wrong.
anyways we got inside and damn what we see? no age class, from teenager to old people of +60 are there.
the party was so lame! so please , if you want to have fun, go somewhere else. and hit the like if you had same bad feeling here.; the whole family was disappointed. average food, high price (but all brunch prices in paris are extremely high). hygiene is not high on their list. we went in order for the children to have fun in the kids corner but it was of no interest to them. no planned activities other than face painting. however the staff is very friendly and helpful!",48.8428073,2.4221133,0.1089444444444444,True,0.1472222222222222,3,75012,New_75012_2269,True

unfortunately the quality decreased since a month and the price raised. my last meal was really not good at all. still a good place for a drink but to avoid now for dinner.; excellent croque monsieur made with truffle bechamel sauce. french fries were perfectly cooked, crispy on the outside, soft on the inside, and the salad was perfect, too. the staff were friendly, kind, and attentive. when they didn't have the wine i requested, the gentleman recommended an excellent replacement. i highly recommend this place. i eat out in paris a lot and i can tell you that food and service here are exceptional!",48.83914900000001,2.3938523,0.0,True,0.0,0,75012,Féli_75012_2278,False

the place is known for their excellent meat, so i have shared a 1kg beef rib to share.
the meat was cooked as requested and was very tender.
the platter looks big but it was quite easy to finish as the slice was not tok thick.
the service is good although it took a little time to serve our order but once appetize came in then the rest just follow nicely.
the waiting was still acceptable and we were not in a rush.
employee were very polite and professional.
i recommend this place if you are nearby, try any of their meat and their gratins.
be aware that parking lot is quite difficult in this area, you may come in advance to look for a place to park first.
see you again next time.; excellent experience dining at le bovincennes.
the servers all spoke english and were lovely to interact with. they explained the dishes in detailed and made the entire experience even better.

quick shout out to the little biscuits and mushroom spread that was served at the start of the meal. it was simple and yet so appetising!

for the entree, i ordered poêlée de pétoncles et crème de poireaux. the scallops were fresh and the cream sauce was just too thick enough but not overwhelming.

the highlight of the meal of course was what the restaurant is known for. their steaks. it was great and not so at the same time. a tale of 2 halves.
i ordered medium rare and one half of the steak was cooked to perfection but the other half was disappointingly raw. i sent it back to be re-cooked but that deteriorated the meat significantly already.

i did not order any dessert as i was already stuffed. i would definitely come back to try the desserts.

overall it was still a very enjoyable meal, i would definitely return again just to give it another chance.; the meat was ordered to be medium rare but was served a well done tomahawk? the fries was boring and with no flavour so was the sauce. wouldn’t recommend this over any other place in paris.; we went 8 guys into getting a nice evening at this restaurant, the waiter wasn’t patient at all, our food came fast, but the food wasn’t good, we all asked for medium rare, and all the beefs were either completely raw or completely cooked through. i wouldn’t go here unless you’re ready to spend 200+ euro for a beef; fancy atmosphere. the server was very polite. the food was actually not that good, unfortunately.",48.84453689999999,2.4343339,0.0,True,0.0,1,94300,LeB_94300_2292,True

the service was fantastic and we were seated and served really quickly, which was fantastic to see! the food, however, was nothing to write home about and ended up being quite average.

i went for the eggs benedict, which was okay. the hollandaise sauce was runny and lacked flavour and one of my eggs was hard, but the portion was really generous and the french fries had a really nice taste and texture to them.

my fiancé went for the hot wings which were, again, pretty average and, for hot wings, had absolutely zero spice to them. he, too, enjoyed the generous portions, french fries and coleslaw though!

all-in-all, indiana café is an okay place to grab a quick bite if you’re in a rush, as you’ll be served extremely quickly which is really convenient. however, if you’re looking for amazing quality and a stellar dining experience, there are much better places seconds away in bercy village.; i loved this place!
we didn’t have to wait for a table and service was fast and friendly.
the food was honestly so delicious. after a day of walking around it was nice just sit and have comfort food.
i had the chili con carne and it was one of the best ones i’ve ever had 😳 lived every bite!
my friends were also super happy with their food!; omg loved it.  such a great place.
so lively.
we were so hungry after disneyland visit. and this place just made our day more special.
although food took a while to come but it was worth the wait.

had indiana burger, american burger, kids meal cheese burger and kids chicken nuggets.

food 10/10
service 10/10
ambience 10/10
prices 9/10; came here twice. wouldn’t come back. food is below average… i wanted to try give it a second chance due to the largely positive reviews. maybe it’s a decent place for a drink, but do not come here to eat! atmosphere and service ok. ordered the brisket mac and cheese… i received dry pasta with melted cheese on top, with a few strings of very dry and flavourless beef. previous time i ordered the chicken nachos, which were ok but not great either. had to ask for the bill three times before finally receiving it, and nobody bothered to ask how the meal was until after i already paid…; very nice restaurant with fun vibes! the food was delicious. we ordered the cheese burger and avocado toast 😋 very generous portions.

will definitely come back 😊; we came a long way from the center to try these burgers. the waiter told us that there was no way for us to sit inside because a larger group made a reservation (even though there was still a small table we couldn’t sit there). i think it was his boss that insisted and i felt that he was really sorry about having to place us outside in the cold. i asked him for a recommendation and he showed us the two most popular burgers on the menu. we ordered both of them (the pulled pork and pulled beef). the pork one was excellent, 5/5 stars… the beef one we didn’t enjoy that much… that’s why i decided to place it in the middle at 4/5. the waiter later explained us the beef one is a traditional french recipe and the beef is slow cooked in a wine. i personally didn’t like this strong wine taste in the burger. the potatoes were okay… a bit too oily and lacking salt.
i also found the area a bit creepy at night (we went there around 10-11pm) because we came with the train and returned with the bus, and on our way back a homeless guy persecuted us. when we turned in the main street he left.

we decided to go back into les spectacles. the staff there were very upset to hear what had happened & tried to get us some tickets. they were very kind & offered my friend & myself a free drink.
being shown such kindness really cushioned our disappointment.
the camaraderie amongst the staff was great to see too.
i will definitely be visiting again on my next trip to paris.
put les spectacles on your list of places to visit especially before a concert as they play music by the artist you are seeing that night which is a perfect way to start your evening.
thank you to you all 🥰; the ambience is good and it is located very close to the bercy station. but the waiter was giving us a weird look for no reason like he’s not happy to serve us. he also charged us 12€ for two cappuccinos which is too much, too pricy.; such a terrible experience.
unpleasant service, overpriced drinks and a waiter who will happily cheat on the bill if you don’t check the credit card machine.
never saw that in paris !!!; okay, but no ketchup); absolutely terrible service.

i got a beer without any bubbles (and not the brand i ordered) which i asked politely to be changed. this turned out to become a major issue with the staff, and two separate servers objected to my request.

for that reason, i instead asked for the beer simply to be taken back as i didn’t want it, which they again strongly objected to, and said i would be charged regardless.

prices are incredibly high, and the food is terrible. i ordered a lamb special, and the meat was so fatty that i literally choked on it three times trying to swallow it before finally spitting it out. this restaurant has made me want to become a vegetarian. although apparently the veggie burger was also bad, according to my colleague.

service was also terrible: it was several minutes before we even got menus, and many more minutes until someone arrived to take our order (long after people next to us, who sat down later, had ordered).

on the plus side, other people like it, so there's probably just something wrong with me... as long as you don't get anything either with meat or vegetables, and don't care how much you pay, you'll probably be fine.; it was great place. the staff was very kind and the food was delicious.; great place but that should do a second toilet… the line to the toilet is too long… the place is great  but prices are steep for the area; absolutely horrible cocktail named l’été grec. sweetest thing i ever tried",48.8265342,2.3598635,0.0,True,0.0,0,75013,L'Ag_75013_2543,False

titu, the server, was setting up outside and asked us to step in as he saw i was having a hard time reading menu in the dark.

place had excellent vibe with young newlyweds celebrating their nuptials.

we were given a table for 4, even tho my wife and i were just two. immediately not treating us a tourists

we started with escargot, the bone marrow (huge and filled with an insane amount of wonderfully buttery marrow. took like 10 baguette slices, at least, to finish it off.

valentina had the andouilette and i had the lamb shank.

the andouilette was wonderfully but not overwhelmingly funky and fabulously complemented by the mashed potatoes.

the lamb shank was without a doubt the best i have ever had. as owner of a nyc michelin forchette provençal resto, i’ve had many lamb shanks but not like this. moist, just enough fat and so sweet and herbaceous, i swear i could taste the pasture the sheep grazed in. it came with penne in a very flavorful but not overwhelming and not acidic at all tomato sauce.

as i’m not a huge lover of pasta with tomato sauce i asked for a 1/2 portion of the mashed potatoes which were complementary.

we had a very nice pic saint loup with the meal

charles, the owner behind the bar, was kind to send us a couple rum digestifs to end our wonderful evening

we left with the rain gone and the evening warm. on way home we found €20 to put a cherry on a wonderful experience

for starters we had veloute of courgette and ouefs mayonnaise, both startlingly underseasoned to the extent that i felt self-conscious with my over use of the salt shaker. in spite of the lack of salt of both dishes, i could tell that there was good quality ingredients involved. i love the mustard of the mayonnaise and the shower of spring onions and parsley on the eggs as well as something crunchy that could be fried onion.

our mains were bouef bourguignon and magret canard, the latter which was a beautiful duck breast cooked to perfection, yielding juicy red meat with deep flavor. rather than potatoes, jules chose sautéed veg and mushrooms, which were a perfect and fresh accompaniment to the meat. my beef oddly lacked the rosy hue that one would expect from having been stewed for hours in bourguignon. in spite of that detail the beef was fairly tender, and the mushrooms cooked with it were delightful however as with the soup and the eggs, a healthy sprinkling, and then re-sprinkling and another re-sprinkling of salt were necessary to enhance the flavor of the meat and its accompanying sauce. while i would’ve preferred mash, the rice was actually a really gentle and appropriate bed for the stew.

we ended our meal with the highly praised profiterole dessert which was quite good with a warm and very light chocolate sauce poured over the ice cream filled choux.

all in all we enjoyed our meal, the good service and the vintage ambience of au moulin à vent.; i’ve been dining at “le moulin à vent” every time i visit paris with my girlfriend for the past eight years, and it never disappoints. last night was no exception. the “plat du jour” was a shoulder of lamb, which we decided to try, and it was absolutely exquisite. our italian waiter, fluent in several languages, made the experience even more special—he was incredibly friendly, welcoming, and had an impressive knowledge of wine. this place isn’t your typical pretentious french restaurant; the atmosphere was vibrant and lively. highly recommended!; everything is delicious.
it's a must to have the escargots,  os a moelle, and the profiterole for dessert.

* the waitress with a braided hair (unsure of her name) who took our order asked us whether we wanted dessert at the end of our meal but due to my family not being able to understand english fully, i repeated what she said to my family and she mistakenly thought i was correcting her pronunciation 🥲. if the owner is reading this, please show her this and let her know that her service is superb and so is her english!!! i could tell that she was a bit frustrated / upset but we were rushing to other places and i left without getting the chance to explain it to her!! 🥹; nice sit down place with great food. we got the 'to share' smoley samin platter. im forgetting the exact name but it came with a bunch of items including spring rolls as well. everything taste really good.; went there once on holiday , the atmosphere is phenomenal , the waiter guy is friendly , the foood is good with the combo make it very affordable.overall 10/10 rating tbh; best café so far that i’ve tasted in paris !

overall, fantastic dining.; me and my partner came here to celebrate our anniversary. unfortunately, we were extremely disappointed by the food and the service, even though after checking the reviews online, our expectations were high.

firstly, the waiter was extremely cold and unwelcoming. we felt as if no-one wanted us there. he didn’t even bother bringing us napkins and placed our cutlery on the dirty table. the menus we got were paper, ones that previously had gotten wet, because they were wrinkled and the ink had spilled. (the restaurant had normal, big menus with proper covers, but for some reason we were the only ones who got the paper ones)

secondly, the food was awful, although at first it looked promising. our dishes were tasteless and unseasoned. it was extremely disappointing, because the dishes are not cheap. i’m just glad, i didn’t get anything more pricier. complete and utter waste of money. we decided to skip on dessert because of the quality of our dinner.

the only good thing here was the wine, it was delicious.

what was supposed to be a romantic evening, quickly was turned sour by incredibly unwelcoming service, complete ignorance and god awful food. this was the worst service we’ve received and the worst food we’ve eaten our entire trip.; this restaurant didn't meet our expectations. the snails were disappointing, and while the duck was decent, the service was lacking. the crème brûlée tasted like it had gone bad, so i didn't eat it. we experienced long wait times, and it felt like the waiter was rushing to get rid of us. on the positive side, the wine was excellent, and the prices were reasonable.; a nice choice to go if you want taste traditional french food. we ordered the foie gras, the onion soup and snails for the starter. and beef steak, brass and duck drumstick for the main dishes. they are really delicious!",48.849584,2.298964,0.0,True,0.0,0,75015,LAG_75015_2654,False

however, all the food they served was extraordinary!! there are mostly duck-related options, with different, exquisite sauces, including some personal recipes. they are all accompanied by sauteed potatoes, which were very nicely prepared!

they have a nice desert choice which is ""4 random mini-deserts"", which we enjoyed for a fair price.

you must try it.; i cannot praise café daguerre nearly enough for their exceptional breakfast experience! from the moment we stepped in, we were greeted warmly by the staff and seated promptly in a cozy and inviting atmosphere.

oh, the food! so much food! we needed 2 tables  (no joke) to fit everything they brought to us  every bite was a symphony of flavors. the omelette was perfectly cooked, fluffy, and packed with melted cheese. the croissant was flaky and buttery, just as it should be, and paired perfectly with the freshly baked baguette. and let's not forget about the fresh squeezed juice - it was like sipping sunshine in a glass, bursting with vibrant flavors and nutrients. and of course, the coffee was divine, providing the perfect caffeine kick to start the day.

but what truly sets the café apart was the impeccable service. the staff went above and beyond to ensure that every guest felt welcome and attended to. their attention to detail and genuine hospitality made my dining experience truly unforgettable.

i was expecting the fish soup to be a bouillon with fish parts, but it was a crème soup instead; i cannot blame the restaurant for my mistake.
caesar salad was very good but was missing some croutons.
onion soup was tasteful, but be aware that the amount of cheese on top is huge, what makes the soup pretty salty.
the staff was extremely friendly.; very nice place 👍🏻 even though it’s located in a very touristy area it’s does not feel that way at all! a lot of local people eating there which a good sign. very friendly stuff and food is really great. we paid 60€ for two for 2 course meal which is really isn’t expensive!

while the atmosphere of the restaurant was pleasant, the service, food quality, and execution were severely lacking.

first, the service was unprofessional. we had to wait a long time before placing our orders, and it took about 30 minutes for the food to arrive afterward. there were also some mistakes made by the server, which i won’t go into detail about.

as for the food quality, it was disappointing. the pasta wasn’t fresh, the chicken was too dry, the burrata lacked freshness, and both the lamb and other meats were excessively fatty. overall, the food was of low quality, especially considering the high prices.

regarding food preparation, none of my friends who ordered steak or lamb received the cooking they requested. one friend asked for his lamb to be cooked medium rare, but it was so undercooked that it was practically raw, with blood dripping as he ate. the french fries were decent, but overly greasy.

to top it all off, we brought a cake to celebrate our friend's anniversary. when we asked if they could store it in a cooler, they charged us 20 euros for the service.

there’s significant room for improvement in several areas for this restaurant to live up to its potential.; a fair place to eat if you’re in the neighborhood and you have “the fork” discount, otherwise it’s not recommended!

the service was amazing. the guy who took care of our orders was super polite and charismatic, we enjoyed our experience especially because of him. i did not get his name but from the small talk we had i remember that he is originally from india and he had a past girlfriend from romania (the country i am from).; we enjoyed the food. service is good and prices. good busy place with a good vibe.; honestly not so bad. the food is great the restaurant in itself is veryyy nice but i gotta admil the seevice is bad. slow veryyyy slow waiters and they sometimes see you calling, they ignore you.

we went as a group of 4 on a hot summer day. we were welcomed nicely and the host was very patient with the ordering process. since i’ve been to georgia for a holiday and loved the food i wanted the other people to try this cuisine.
it was their first time eating georgian food and they all loved it very much. we shared badridschani (grilled aubergine with a nutty paste) and khachapuri (georgian cheese bread) for starters and then ate other speciality like the ojakhuri (meat with potatoes) and some georgian dumplings (it was not khinkalis but also very tasty). we all liked our food very much and the service was very friendly and welcoming. although i would recommend bringing some time, since they make everything fresh from the spot, you will have to wait a bit for your food to be ready (which is normal, because the dishes take a lot of time to make). highly recommend to go there and try authentic georgian food. the smell and taste transported me right back to my holiday in georgia.

the service good be better, well very very basic. also, they a big line. make sure that there no big company waiting before you - they don’t hurry to fill the available free tables for 2, if they have 4 people waiting first. 😛

no plant based milk options for coffee, a big minus nowadays.; i had high expectations when we chose going to this restaurant after shopping, given its iconic location in the heart of the bon marché, but unfortunately, it did not live up to the hype. the service, in particular, was quite disappointing.

while placing our order, our server, was more focused on chatting with a neighboring table than paying attention to us. he didn’t even make eye contact during our interaction. to make matters worse, he was forgetful and unresponsive. we had to repeatedly ask for water, which eventually arrived after a long wait, and the coffee we ordered was completely forgotten.

the server mentioned we wouldn’t be charged for the coffee due to the long delay, which we appreciated. however, when we received the bill, the coffee was still listed. when we pointed this out, he insisted it couldn’t be removed from the bill, despite what he had promised earlier. while paying for the coffee wasn’t an issue for us, it’s the principle of making a promise and not following through that left a bad impression.

overall, the service was mediocre, especially for a restaurant in such a renowned location. i hope the management takes this feedback seriously and makes the necessary improvements.; situated within le bon marche (market side) with a glass canopy — it had a nice ambience, very much like dining in a greenhouse. i had the special of the day; slow-roasted pork belly which was very tender and flavourful. it was cooked to perfection. i thought i wouldn’t be able to finish it but it was delicious enough to do so. niçoise salad was very good too — generous and fresh. so was their bread + butter (have to request). complimentary madeleines that came with my coffee was fantastic! made in-house daily. service was prompt and attentive (unlike other earlier reviews). the restaurant was full and had a queue. seemed like a popular dining spot even for locals, besides throngs of tourists.; my chicken was good, very tasteful. after a long day of shopping it’s a good place to grab a bite.; not sure why all the negative reviews but i think this place is fantastic. you sit in a relaxing atrium within a department store with great food and staff. even one of the chefs said goodbye as we were leaving. the oysters and prawns we had were fresh and the strawberry dessert was delicious.",48.8504782,2.3233115,0.0,True,0.0,0,75007,LaT_75007_2796,False

i returned on sunday morning but it's a bit different. orange squeeze and pain au chocolat were very nice, but the omelette was not as fluffy and they did not serve creme fraiche.

the menu is good, with lots of meaty options.

the ‘7- hour cooked lamb’ is worth dying for’. the pepper sauce they serve with the steak is the best i have ever had. it is worth asking for some sauce to dip your bread in; it will change your life!

the green beans... again... amazing! compliments to the chef!

coming from south africa, the steak just don’t compare and the quality of the meat is not the same.

even though you ask for ‘well-done’ you still get a piece of meat that is slightly tanned on the outside.

only one waitress understood english, but she left now. for the rest.... just point at the menu and pray.:)

the menu is often changed, but vegetarian options are always available.

overall, 750g is a reliable choice for a casual meal in paris. it's a good option if you're looking for a comfortable place to eat with good food.; an excellent budget bistro.

on several occations there has been room for 2-4 without reservations.

includes options of entree+main or main+desert for 22€, full 3 course for 26€, excellent value for money.

as for the atmosphere, it is functional but nothing remarkable, and the overall experience might feel slightly underwhelming in terms of ambiance. the service, while friendly, could be more attentive, especially given the expectations for dining in paris.

overall, tasca is a good option if you're in the area and need a gluten-free meal, particularly considering the convenience of its location near the eiffel tower. however, for those seeking a more memorable or exceptional gluten-free dining experience, it may be worth exploring some of the other options available in paris through apps like ""find me gluten free,"" as the city offers a range of choices for gluten-sensitive diners.; great location! some of the best gluten free pizza i’ve ever had, we loved our meal. my partner got the gnochhi and it was yummy as well.; went here with my celiac travel partner, and this meal blew me away!

the bread they brought us to start tasted almost just as good as any typical bread.

i was super excited to try the ravioli or tortellini, but as other reviews have stated they were all sold out by dinner time unfortunately. we both ordered the gnocchi (mine was four cheese, hers was truffle) and they were both a pillow-soft texture and so rich in flavor.

the wines we paired were delicious, and our desserts (chocolate mousse for her, pistachio and dark chocolate gelato for me) polished off our meal on a high note.

for context, on our first day in paris, we excitedly looked up on google maps “french fries” - birdy was recommended with fries as a “menu highlight”. there was no one else in the restaurant when we ordered, so can’t blame any sort of rush. very disappointing.

ps: the surrounding area is also filled with cultural attractions worth walking around after lunch or dinner and hear their history.; the pris fixee menu was an outstanding value at €50 per person. the food was delicious and beautifully presented on the plate. a generous amount of good quality wine was served with each course. the waiter poured a good amount of rum on the baba au rum dessert, and then left the bottle on the table in case anybody wanted a little more.  wow!; had a cappuccino here in 2017 in a group trip with my sister and cousin. honestly don't remember anything about the food, but it was fun trying to find this place in google maps off memory.; beautiful restaurant. beautiful staff. american friendly!!! dinner was wonderfully done,  dessert was delicious,  bread was super fresh. will come here again!!",48.8530514,2.3117253,0.0,True,0.0,0,75007,LeV_75007_2938,False

i hope it stays this way.; my experience at this restaurant was absolutely awful, if i could give it less than one star i would. the service is horrible and the staff are extremely rude and discriminatory. me and my dad were at the louvre and decided to stop by here for lunch. my father has cancer and eats a strict diet because of his condition. when we asked about vegan options we were treated rudely and were barely accommodated. i did my best to speak in french and was nothing but kind to the server. upon finishing my main course the server abruptly dumped the remains of my plate onto the table in front of me knowing that i had ordered dessert and it was not there yet. in addition, i watched as the server walked with the used plate, wiped it with a dry cloth and laid it with the clean plates. disgusting.
not to mention we were 1 out of 2 brown families sitting in the restaurant both of whom were treated with a lack of respect from the server and the owner. the other family who sat directly in front of us had brought small children to the cafe. the children, as children do,  began to get playful in the cafe and the owner yelled ferociously at them. i was horrified. paris is a tourist city, in fact we were right down the street from the louvre. that being said, it is evident that many of the customers that eat at this joint would be tourists so it is unfair to expect that everyone will speak french and to treat paying customers rudely because of this is insanely ridiculous. the experience i had at this joint not only showed a lack of hospitality but a lack of humility. the food was subpar but would have tasted much better if they had been kind to us while we were there. this was one of the first and only meals i ate on my trip to paris and it left a sour taste in my mouth for the rest of my trip. i would not recommend this cafe to anyone. a tip to management: food is best served with warmth and kindness.; took over one hour to get the food to our table. when asked, was very rude. food was not good. would not recommend visiting here.; nice 🇩🇰🇩🇰",48.8412884,2.3079654,-0.0366666666666666,True,-0.0458333333333333,2,75015,LeT_75015_2940,True

---

we visited la delizia 174 in paris last night, and it was an unforgettable experience! the food was absolutely delicious, with a truly authentic italian taste that made me feel like i was right in the heart of italy. the cozy, intimate atmosphere of this small restaurant added to its charm, making it a perfect spot for a relaxed meal.

a big highlight of our visit was the owner—his attentiveness and warm hospitality made us feel right at home. i especially loved the lasagna with truffle flavor and mushrooms; it was simply amazing! we will definitely be coming back. highly recommend for anyone seeking a true taste of italy in paris!; small cozy restaurant, the guy tried his best to translate it as well. the burrata is yummy! didnt take the rest of food, but its worth trying if you are near the neighbourhood.; there was nothing good about food at this place. i give 2 stars only because we didn’t have food poisoning.
arancini is good inside but everything is ruined by the fact, that it’s not crispy at all, it tastes like made 2 days ago and reheated in microwave. carbonara doesn’t have guanciale or anything like this, it tastes like cheap ham, i also need to add that it’s made with cream…
ravioli - oh my god. it was served cold inside but what’s funny it is not the worst thing about this dish. in my opinion pasta is the same one you can buy in monoprix or any shop like this. absolutely no! tomato sauce is like just sauce from the bottle, not even seasoned.
and the best one - tiramisu. i don’t think that they add any mascarpone there, it’s like sponge cakes layered with whipped cream.
for appetizer+dish+dessert you have to pay 16 euro if you eat at the restaurant.
i would not recommend it to anyone who wants to enjoy meal.; we had a magnificent time at this restaurant. the food was delicious and the owners were so very kind, warm, and generous. on top of that, their prices are very reasonable. i highly recommend having a meal at la delizia.; we used to come here to buy some italian cold cuts and cheese and it was delicious.
the place is now suitable for a dinner as well.
the staff is friendly and always smiling.
the platters taste good. we tested the antipasti platter and the buffala as starters: it was really tasty.
we had liguine with truffles: could do better in taste but it’s still good.
the bolognese lasagna was also good.
an overall good experience.",48.8414939,2.2984615,0.0,True,0.0,0,75015,LaD_75015_2996,False

mind you the restaurant was not busy, it was actually pretty empty (makes sense now after i have read other terrible reviews) there were about 4 other tables that were being served on the inside.

the only small downside was that there were just two servers, so as the restaurant filled up, it became harder to get their attention, which delayed our departure after we finished dining. however, this was a minor issue in an otherwise delightful experience. overall, i highly recommend this restaurant for anyone looking to enjoy a great meal in paris.; excellent food, wine and service. focus on fish and vegetarian with a few meat options. high quality and very good value. had a three course menu with a bottle of wine. always great wine suggestions here.",48.8591363,2.2831409,0.0,True,0.0,0,75016,LaP_75116_3103,False

since this restaurant is located in an affluent neighborhood, many well to do people dine here. there is a section inside the restaurant reserved just for the vips.

this restaurant knows how to serve the vips. they provide impeccable service and the food always come out succinctly. our waitress was very attentive and called my friend by name.

people come here for their gourmet food. all the food we ordered were delicious and fantastic. my friend loved the beef dish and he said that the meats were so flavorful and tender.

my miso glazed salmon was so good too. the fish meat was so tender that it melted in my mouth. with the miso glaze, the salmon tasted amazing.

i have to mention that the egg roll appetizer was one of the best in town. i felt it was better than the ones from the vietnamese restaurant we had the previous night.

we were so thankful that my friend took us there for lunch. this has been the best meal we have had since we arrived in paris.; we were fortunate to find this lovely restaurant not to far from the hôtel molitor. we arrived just after 2pm, when many restaurants are closed. it was relatively empty and we were treated well and promptly by the staff.

we shared the smoked salmon starter, which was amazing and huge! we were glad we shared. my tiger steak was prepared correctly at medium rare and melted in flavorful bites. her fish and asparagus was like wise light and flaky and well seasoned.

our petit millefeuille was wonderful but a bit small to share. the salmon at the start more than compensated. if you don’t get a huge appetizer, get your own desserts.

we will look to revisit here on our next trip.; very nice restaurant with good wine and good food. had the chance to have dinner with my co-workers and the food was really good. large variety of dishes and wine. we had the pastèque salad to start (watermelon, cucumber, tomatoes, olives and feta) which was very tasty. the sea bass was next - well presented and tasty. the spinach could have used more seasoning but all in all it was a good dinner. the place was packed as the juventus - paris game was happening, so if you go before an event, make sure to make a reservation 😉",48.8476902,2.2591146,0.0,True,0.0,0,75016,LeM_75016_3193,False

firstly, i must acknowledge the stunning decor of the restaurant. the attention to detail in the interior design created a beautiful and inviting ambiance. the tasteful decorations and comfortable seating added to the overall charm of the place, creating a pleasant atmosphere for dining.

however, i was disappointed with the initial service i received upon arrival. despite the restaurant not being full, it took longer than expected for the staff to seat us. it seemed like they were understaffed, as there were only two waiters for the entire terrace and outdoor section. this lack of attention affected the overall efficiency and service quality, leaving a negative impression.

moving on to the food, i have to admit that most of the dishes we ordered were delicious. the flavors were well-balanced, and the presentation was visually appealing. however, the crispy gambas with curry sauce was a disappointment. the dish was not well prepared, as evident from the picture i took. the prawns were overcooked, looking rather dark and lacked the desired crispiness. it was clear that the chef responsible for the fryer was not experienced in handling seafood dishes.

it is worth mentioning that the staff, although not particularly attentive, was polite and accommodating when approached. however, due to the understaffing issue, it was challenging for them to provide the level of service one would expect from a restaurant of this caliber.

with some improvements in service and more attention to detail in food preparation, this restaurant has the potential to become a top seafood destination.; great experience!! the food was really good especially the mussels! service was so great the staff (all of them that served us) were great!! best experience for us throughout our entire paris trip. very adorable as well!",48.8671342,2.2799349,0.0,True,0.0,0,75016,Peti_75016_3199,False

contrary to the ratings, we found the restaurant quite good. service was top class. we ordered the menu (chicken roast, egg salad and ice cream), onion soup, penne pasta and crepes.
the quantity of each dish was more than adequate.
except the roast chicken which was as a 4 star, i would rate every other dish a 4.5-5 star. the ice cream was especially delicious and the pasta was surprisingly good. overall for the price, we were very satisfied.; located in trocadero and near eiffel. so it’s a touristy area and ofcourse a bit pricey

i ordered entrecote steak and it’s good. well i think it just need more veggie on the side

staff are friendly but i have to wait for a long time for my dessert; we had the lunch menu- it’s nice you can switch your options at a small additional cost. the tartar was very well seasoned, but some of the other dishes were bland and dry, like the chicken and the steak. overall, it’s an okay place with okay food.; overall, this experience was not one of our favorites in paris.

first off, the food was pretty unflattering, and didn’t have much taste. the steak came out pretty stiff and the tartar was completely filled with capers which completely took away from the taste of the beef.

also, the staff had forgotten about my plate so i sat waiting for my plate for a while after everyone else had gotten theres. not a big deal, it happens, but just a bit inconvenient.

i do have to say that our server, who had red hair, was very very nice and attentive to us.; we ordered the menu, the starters was good but when the meat arrived was tough, we ordered it medium and it was not good cooking. the fries were not good at all. the ice cream was ok, the portion is really generous but and if the main curse you can't eat it, the entree and dessert don't save the restaurant.  if you go, don't order the meat, it looks very good, but you won't be able to eat it.",48.8634151,2.2881067,0.0,True,0.0,0,75016,LeW_75116_3219,False

they also have a nice selection of fresh bakery available for take away, and a long queue of people waiting to take their coffee and bakery to go, which says how good this is 😋.

the outdoor seating is a lovely touch, providing a relaxing atmosphere to enjoy the meal. if you’re in the area, i highly recommend stopping by for a bite!!!; insects flying around and parking on our food felt unpleasant and a bit disgusting having it on our meals, trying to always deal with them instead of focusing on eating. this broke our experience considering that inside place is pretty small and busy.

have to mention staff was very fast and helpful also, speaking both french and english with us; lovely little café with indoor and outdoor seating.

additionally there were some administrative issues when it came to pay to do with our deposit. nevertheless, it was an incredible experience and for groups not as large as ours i can highly recommend!

the issues we faced were definitely unique to our specific situation with such a large group, they are not going to be reflective of a typical experience so please don’t let us discourage you from visiting!; this hard rock is very unassuming from the street view but is very cozy and lively inside.  the  employees were all helpful and friendly.  our server was the greatest, patient and kind.  i had the messi chicken sandwich; come with an appetite, that’s all i got to say.  we also had the ribs, the meet was falling of the bone tender.  they have 50% off drink specials in the early evening, yum; even non alcoholic for the kids.; as we are a fan of hard rock, we already knew the standards of service and foods. amazing as always! 👏🏼

a big thanks to a lovely server there, she was very attentive and friendly. our salad was missing and i was a bit disappointed but she tried her best to manage it for us, we understood how busy and crowded it was.. result was impressive. 👍🏼

one thing to note, we came from switzerland to paris (visited almost 10 times) and we speak german and english.. there was a bartender (i prefer not to mention the name) he was not so happy once we said we are from switzerland.. his reaction was strange, the way he spoke to us was not friendly at all. he even asked if we speak german? with a tone of voice that i concluded that he didn’t like that we speak german. (i was speaking german to my daughter, though my husband speaks fluent french.. my husband pretended to don’t speak french to him just to see how he would serve us) my husband ignored this ridiculous reaction and we didn’t take it seriously or personally, but as a world class restaurant i expect more that the workers are used to meet people all around the world who speak different languages.; the experience was quite enjoyable, and i would recommend it to anyone looking for a classic american dining experience with a touch of parisian flair.
i ordered the legendary burger, and my companion opted for the big cheese burger. both burgers were cooked to medium-well perfection, with juicy patties and fresh toppings. the fries were crispy and well-seasoned, making for a delightful side. the serving size was generous, and the presentation was on point. the aioli dipping sauce added an extra layer of flavor to the meal.
while the prices are on the higher side, the quality of the food and the overall dining experience justify the cost. our total bill came to €56.40, which included two burgers and two sodas. given the portion sizes and the quality, it was a reasonable expenditure for a special dining occasion.
hard rock cafe paris offers a solid dining experience with delicious food, great service, and a lively atmosphere. it’s a fantastic spot for both locals and tourists looking to enjoy a meal in a fun and iconic setting. i would definitely visit again and recommend it to others.",48.87194419999999,2.3416045,-0.0645,True,-0.075,1,75009,Hard_75009_3256,True

with cheaper prices also 😉👌; cool local bar! i've been here a few times and it was always a nice experience.
to order drinks you normally go to the bar and bring them to your table, so don't always expect that once you sit servers will come to you because that's not the general type of service here.
you pay at the bar and receive the drinks upon payment so even quicker than waiting for service to bring drinks so rather efficient and quick!; great pub for drinks.
it's the cheapest in the area and is cleaner and more pleasant than the more expensive options. the staff are friendly and diligent, it's also a good place to go for foreigners as the staff and regulars are welcoming.

a few notes for people. a) the bar doesn't offer any good, you are allowed to eat your own food from elsewhere on site. b) the service is often at the bar, ie the staff won't always come to your seat, for me this is great as i prefer ordering at the bar c) it gets very busy after around 6, so you don't often have a place to sit.; super chill place to hang out affordable drinks and have great crowd all around had a great time spent almost 4 hours till it closed had a great great time night a bunch of shots for so many awesome people i had pleasure cross paths 🙏🏽🙏🏽 for tourist it’s a perfect place to visit :); 19.8 absolutely lovely lady making great drinks, greetings from finland, coming back 😘",48.8907215,2.3202325,0.0,True,0.0,0,75017,Les_75017_3282,False

let's start with the service. the staff at bachaumont were attentive, friendly, and went above and beyond to ensure our dining experience was top-notch. from the moment we walked in, we were greeted with warm smiles and a genuine willingness to make our visit memorable. the staff even showed us to a private dining room, which was a pleasant surprise and showcased their commitment to providing a personalized experience.

now, let's talk about the cocktails. bachaumont definitely knows their craft when it comes to mixology. the cocktails were expertly crafted, with a perfect balance of flavors. each sip was a delight, and they truly complemented the dining experience.

speaking of the food, there were a few standout dishes that i highly recommend. the prime rib steak was cooked to perfection, tender, and full of flavor. it was a true carnivore's delight. the salads were fresh, vibrant, and bursting with seasonal ingredients. and let's not forget the truffle pasta, which was a heavenly combination of rich truffle flavor and perfectly cooked pasta.

however, i must mention that the sea bass carpaccio fell short of expectations. it was under-seasoned and lacked the wow factor that the other dishes had. while it didn't ruin the overall dining experience, it was a slight disappointment.

overall, my experience at bachaumont was exceptional. the service was impeccable, the cocktails were a delight, and the prime rib steak, salads, and truffle pasta were highlights. i would highly recommend this restaurant for a special occasion, a private dinner, or simply a memorable dining experience in paris.; simply amazing! i have stayed at the hotel many times and this was my second time dining here. staff were extremely friendly and helpful with great pairing recommendations. if you are in the area or at the hotel make a reservation and don’t miss this opportunity. also order a dessert!; charming restaurant with wonderful breakfast and dinner options. however, the service in this place is absolutely lacking (especially given the price). there is a young, short man in the morning wearing round glasses and all-black clothing who is just the embodiment of “ennuit” - he doesn’t greet you, he’s emotionless, and when you ask for something he just doesn’t care. it just turns our experience so sour & makes us not want to come back. such a shame…; dinner here last night, the decision based on menu and past reviews. it was a very good decision!

my date and i were seated quickly with advance reservations. the atmosphere is comfortable and inviting, at the first floor of the hotel bachaumont.
our server was friendly and quick, very welcoming.
we started with the courgette flowers, a delicious seasonal delicacy.
next, we had the angus beef entree and the boneless smoked veal chops, with side vegetables.  everything was delicious and cooked to perfection.
we elected not to have dessert,  although what we saw looked fabulous.

in short, make a reservation and go enjoy a great restaurant!; amazing food, amazing experience.
our best meal in paris was here. the lunch menu with 3 courses was out of the world. (my son's words)
staff was very accommodating for us, i really recomend it, for the food, the experience, the service, and the great atmosphere, the price was for us surprisingly not much.",48.86628169999999,2.3450414,0.0,True,0.0,0,75002,Rest_75002_3300,False

our food was all lovely but i will admit by the time i got to my monster of a profiterole, i was defeated and sadly could not finish as i was too full from the previous good food 😅

would definitely visit again next time we are in paris and it was the perfect ending to our trip; we went to brasserie barbès as a group of colleagues during the paralympic games, and it was a great experience. they seated us on the top floor, where we enjoyed a nice view. we ordered drinks and food, and everything was wonderful.

i loved my drink, although i’m not sure what it was called since my boss ordered it for me, but the cocktail tasted great. for food, i had a burger, and it was delicious—the sauce, which was like butter, added an extra touch that made it even better.

one cool thing i need to mention is how we paid the bill. we just scanned a qr code, split the bill, and paid with apple pay, all without anyone bringing a payment machine. isn’t that amazing?

we had a big room for 1 night which was perfect. the baby cot was in the room when we arrived, plenty of space for us which made our stay very comfortable! (big fridge, table and chairs in the room, spacious bathroom)

we liked the concept of the hotel: no plastic, nice shower products, restaurant with organic food…

easy to access by metro, on a quiet area with a park close by.

only negative point if i have to mention something: the window on the ceiling isn’t good, the light pass through the curtain.; my go to rooms in paris. a bit out of the way but the price and quality is worth a metro or taxi ride; liked: hotel stuff around was really kind, good mood around, modern and comfortable facilities. there was no problem with breakfast time, amount and taste of meals. room equipment at standard level (e.g. hairdryer, towels, toiletries, ....). restaurant staff really kind, friendly - more then satisfied with services. there could be some negatives about location, but lot of these are expected because of travel references (location, safety feeling, ...)

disliked: during the stay there was no complications but some negative emotions (extremely crowded metro line,...), check-in little bit complicated e.g. 24/7 reception was not working completely - ringing the doorbell for few times, no additional information about stay (check-in around 01:00am, because of flight complications), we paid taxes for two times (first time just for one night, next one for the other two nights). little bit harder to find exact location in the night; very nice hotel with friendly staff and pretty, clean rooms. breakfast was great, also nice that you have the option to have diner at the hotel. the location is good, public transport is at walking distance and outside the busy crowded luxurious paris city center (which we liked). it was nice to be around 'normal' people and not just tourists. there are plenty of shops and places to eat nearby. i would definitely come back here if i visit paris again.
if i can give two suggestions: 1) please fix the shower so that in the morning when everyone is showering the water does not go from very hot/ice cold; 2) it would be nice to have some sort of closet space, since we now had to improvise with the window frame, tables and the floor.
besides that, very pleasant stay!; overall, this was an amazing hotel to stay at and i will go out of my way to come back here next time i am in paris (or any of the places they look to be opening). the concept is wonderful with stylish and chic decor as well as great activities. this is definitely the place to stay for young professionals and style-conscious travellers aged 20-40. that is not to say it is only for young people: i stayed here with my parents and they also found it lovely for a handful of nights in paris.

pros:
- impeccable style
- cool and helpful staff
- almost everything is easily accessible by metro and uber/bolt from the center is cheap
- lively neighbourhood. we did not feel unsafe
- reasonable underground parking (though be aware of the gate, it is not open very long when you try to get out so you basically need to be two people with one driving and one entering the code)
- fair pricing
- check-out at noon
- absolutely wonderful bar

cons:
- some rooms are tiny. there does not seem to be a price difference nor a choice between the tiniest rooms and the more reasonably-sized regular rooms.
- we checked out on a sunday around 11 am, which is expected to be a busy check-out time. additionally, there had been a big rugby world cup game the night before so there were many people checking out. there was, however, only a single person at the desk. combining this with many people apparently having small booking/payment issues, it meant standing in line for an unreasonable 30 minutes with guests getting very frustrated. this would have been so easily avoidable with just a little foresight.",48.9055725,2.3358291,0.3196666666666666,False,0.3805555555555555,1,93400,MOB_93400_3439,True

motor skills workshops, free time,...
there is a protected exterior with games for children but also a small gardening area!; my son started school last september (2021), at 2 years and 8 months!! :))) luckily i found this kindergarten, because in my area, i don't have a kindergarten with a very small section. the team is attentive, more than competent, with a very elaborate educational program. my son has not experienced the community (parental leave + health context) and this human-sized kindergarten is the perfect solution! i recommend 1000 times and without reservation!; my daughter entered the pelloutier kindergarten at the age of two and a half. now she is in the middle section. we are very happy to see its progress each year thanks to the team at this kindergarten. a superb teaching team, involved, caring and passionate about their profession. in addition, the director has put an application through which we monitor the work of our children.
thank you élodie.
i can only recommend this kindergarten.; the pelloutier garden is a structure supporting children from 2 and a half years old until they start primary school. the number of classes being smaller, the child adapts and becomes familiar more easily with contact with others. my daughter was delighted to spend superb years rich in education within this structure. many fun and educational activities are offered every day so that the child grows properly. i recommend all parents to come and see this structure by participating in the information meetings. another big thank you to the entire pelloutier kindergarten team.; my daughter has been attending kindergarten since she was 2 1/2 years old, and despite the distance from our home she will stay there until she starts first grade.
i highly recommend all parents to register their children. the management team is top notch (special mention for elodie the director!), we have access to an application on which photos and information are posted very frequently which allows us to follow what our children are doing. communication is fluid and very easy, we know what happens daily for our children the educational method is really good: they (100% female team) adapt to the rhythm of each child and respect it, while following the program. national education.

after that, ignored by the seller, i decided to do what i should have done from the beginning: help myself... and i saw several color models of the size i was looking for: red, gray, light blue... so, i ask him to try the gray and he says no, sorry, the boss doesn't want more than 2 fittings, we're not at zara here! so finished...
i insist because, at the moment, i did not have the feeling of trying anything apart from one and a half costumes imposed on my son by the seller, and i had not been informed from the start of the rules strict of this gentleman... he accepts but this will be my last fitting.
i finally bought the last one because we must not hide it, the costumes are very beautiful and very well cut but the moment and the sale were an extremely painful and very unpleasant moment.
despite everything, i was subsequently able to speak by telephone with a manager who was very attentive and concerned about this problem.; great welcome and advice, i came with a tired and sick little one who refuses the fittings, they managed to calm him down and find him a perfect costume! thank you so much :)",48.8827752,2.3504973,0.42535,True,0.4525,2,75010,Maga_75010_3540,True

still wouldn’t come back; came here with our baby and 3 year old. not too busy here and could fit our buggy in as well. service was warm and friendly and we really appreciated that they went out of their way to help us with washing a bottle and providing boiling water for baby formula. food was nice and came quickly. we had mussels, steak and chicken skewer and all were delicious and cooked well. around £23 per main with a soft drink.

only downside was there was no baby change so we had to use the floor of the washroom.; we went for a late lunch as a group and loved this place!

with these prices and the offering, frankly, get a better burger somewhere else.

location is great, especially if somebody has to catch a train from gare du nord
the food was delicious – every dish we chose was full of flavor and a different experience. we chose tapas style by taking several starters: falafel, artichoke, fish carpaccio, and a side of potato skins.
this was not my first time – each time the food has been great.
the service has varied in the past, but it was very good on this most recent visit

the photo was taken from the window so i could help my colleague find the restau.

i ordered a chicken burger with avocado, but unfortunately, the avocado was unripe and hard, which was unexpected. the fries, on the other hand, were softer than i prefer. the prices were a little high comparative to other fast food places. despite these small issues, i still enjoyed the overall experience, the aesthetic was nice with all deco and will likely be back.; this is definitely one of my best burger places in paris.
the portion was good and the sauces and spices used gave it a good taste.
their salad was beyond amazing and i recommend it to everyone (a bit expensive for a salad in a fast food place but worth it).
prices were acceptable but they could use some promotions to attract more people.
the atmosphere was good and the place was clean.
their home made ice tea is a must try to; we have order 2 burgers. 1x fries and 1x sweet potato.
burgers were amazing. each of two had different taste and was original. sweet potatos was little too soft and fries little dry but overall really enjoy the food and the interior decor was wonderfully atmospheric and very american; best burger i’ve had in paris - great meat, sauce, and even the bun was 5 star.  and at a great people watching spot if you can get a table outside.  will definitely be back.; best burger in town, juicy meat, amazing souces! and bread was so good that i finished full burger and i didn't feel any heaviness after eating. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️",48.8656377,2.3468396,0.0,True,0.0,0,75002,Manh_75002_3616,False

the tartare beef is served with peanuts and is gentle in taste. i find it interesting but i don’t describe it in a surprising way. i expected it rawer as a beef tartare should be. the sauce in the starter amazes me and i hope i would know how they make them so that i could try to do it on my own.; we waited an hour for our food, only to be told they'd completely forgotten about our order. the place was being run by two rather aggressive students, particularly the girl at the counter, who proceeded to shout at us when we calmly expressed our frustration about the service. she seemed to take offence at the notion that we expected to be served.

now, i believe ""service"" and ""serve"" stem from the same root. if serving people isn’t your thing, perhaps it’s time to reconsider the profession.

the food is outstanding, particularly their french-style steak, which is both popular and delicious. the fries and sides complemented the meal perfectly, and the bread was exceptional.

a highlight of my visit was their homemade wines, which were incredibly delicious and surpassed even the food in my estimation.

i highly recommend la forge to travelers in paris. explore their menu, especially the wine selection, for a memorable dining experience that captures the essence of french cuisine and hospitality.; very nice food. we had escargots and filet mignon and canard. and for dessert french toast and apple pie. crowded, but still the owner made sure we got enough attention and didn’t need to wait too long.; only a first impression and i really wanted to like it but good food accompanied by incredibly slow service (even by french standards) killed this place. the older gentleman two tables over from me waited for about forty minutes between appetizer and entree, so long in fact that he stabbed his steak knife into the table and glared at the staff. now, i don't approve of such behavior, and it was as awkward as it was entertaining, but it was nice to know it wasn't just me who got the service at the speed of a snail. also, the à point steak came out bien cuit. though i will say the fois gras was delicious and the sauces and fries that accompanied the steak were also good. i'll give the place another shot but it's a bit of a gamble to go in my opinion.; truly excellent. noticed some lovely attention to detail such as the pre seasoning of the potatoes they used for the fries so the fries themselves don't need salt. would recommend.; service was okay here (apart from staff insisting on speaking english despite me being fluent in french) and there was a good buzz to the place. unfortunately the snails must have been off because they gave me quite severe food poisoning (3 days out of action). that aside, the fruit sauce on my wife's duck was very grainy. for the price we would have expected much better.",48.8782361,2.3737982,0.0,True,0.0,0,75019,LaF_75019_3764,False

even if he adapted really well from his first montessori school to the public school, i was very disappointed of the public method of education and specially on the socialisation aspects of the education.
so i was lucky to find a place for my son at petit d’homme, i found a open communication, a positive educational approach that really follows maria’s montessori views, and a beautiful ambiance.
i can really see that the teachers duos work so well and that they have so much experience. this is very reassuring for me as a parent and for my son. the ambiance just has a great flow.
my son was integrated really quick with the group and goes happily to school every morning. he even asks to stay at the garderie to play longer with his friends.
the educators were always attentive to his needs and even to our needs as a family. i’m brazilian and had to travel during the school year and they were very understanding and accommodating. the teachers did a whole amazing plan for him to catch up during the trip, but with no pressure.
i love this school and recommend it to parents that are looking for a montessori and a individualized approach to education. so different from the one size fits all of the classic education that is all around in paris.; my daughter has been enrolled at petit d’homme since the start of the school year in september, and her little brother is getting ready to join her.
i can only express my gratitude to the school director and the teaching team, for the exceptional environment offered to our children. 1 teacher for 10 children, great kindness coupled with healthy firmness, the children's rhythm respected. my daughter goes there with pleasure every morning, i see her flourish and progress, and i have total confidence. it’s lucky to have a montessori school at such a reasonable price in the 11th!; not all montessori schools are equal. after a very disappointing experience in the first year of kindergarten in another montessori school, we were lucky enough to have a place for our daughter at le petit d'homme in the second year of kindergarten. our daughter was able to complete her schooling there until the end of cm1 and thrive there. the transition to a cm2 in the public went without problem.; i have 12 years of experience with this school because all my children have completed their entire education from kindergarten to cm2. the teaching is exceptional, quite montessori. they have not only acquired an excellent level without no problem adapting to classical education but also valuable maturity and ability to resolve conflicts. during all these years they went to this school every day with pleasure and have excellent memories of it. like me.; my daughter has been attending le petit d'homme since her first year of kindergarten, she loves her school and so do we! kindness, listening and joy of living are on the menu! the students are mixed on several levels, which promotes mutual assistance and autonomy. everyone advances at their own pace, the material is of high quality, the teaching team is regularly trained and reinforced by the presence of student trainees. i recommend this establishment!",48.8643074,2.3819406,0.3181666666666666,True,0.3458333333333333,4,75011,Scho_75011_3915,True

i usually come here almost 3 to 4 times a week for my morning coffee and to peacefully work on my laptop (with wifi!) without anyone ever making a fuss.

the brasserie is situated on a lovely little corner, just steps from buttes chaumont with two sides to the cafe terrasse allowing one to choose if they want to eat alone/work in peace away from the somewhat busy street or watch the cars and people go by without being bothered.
it appears to be a hit for work lunch as i often see large groups come in and out most often at the middle of the day.

ambiance inside or outside is always a perfect mix of convivial yet calm. prices are exactly what they should be, the menu is short and sweet with fresh ingredients whose quality you can taste. this isn't your stale and tired traditional ""french"" menu nor is it trendy and ridiculous like a french inspired taco... here it appears every plate is thoughtfully approached with only seasonal and local ingredients. each option is a simple yet unexpected pairing: a classic hard boiled egg with mayonnaise mixed with squid ink sauce. the red pepper with feta and almonds was by far my favorite. while i have yet to try the larger plates, each and every entrée has been more than delicious, well-seasoned and well-portioned. this is great if you're like me and your afternoon (unfortunately) doesn't include time for a ""sieste"" immediately following the meal ;)
added bonus! the offering changes just slightly from time to time giving those who frequent the spot a chance to always try something new.

service is always attentive and quick, never pushy or rushed which is why i find it's always filled with people of all ages and backgrounds, families, children, friends or solo.

tables are large and accommodating which is rare to see in paris, especially on the terrace, where in other cafes around the city one typically feels packed in like sardines, forced to sit in on the conversation and cigarette smoke of their neighbor ;) here, each of the tables outside can comfortably fit 4 people.

unfortunately i am no longer living in the area but if you ever find yourself new to the neighborhood, maybe searching for your ""go-to"" spot to enjoy a moment outside the confines of your humble abode, i can't recommend this one enough. for me it feels exactly like home :); this is the worst cafe in the pyrénées area. i have never tasted such a dry croissant. nor had such poor customer service. i advise you to explore other cafes, lest you waste your money in this economy.; great food at fair price and a nice terrace. not fancy but good quality 👌",48.8754008,2.3823087,0.3248888888888889,True,0.3777777777777777,1,75019,Bras_75019_3931,True

we ended up ordering the hamburgers (cheese and texan hamburgers), those tasted very good, served with homemade mayonnaise it think? and potato wedges. definitely would recommend it.

our children didn't really like the sparkling lemonade, so we asked the waiter for glasses of water, which he got us free of charge, excellent service if you ask me.

the restaurant itself does not at all appear to be tourist focus, we were dining amongst locals (just the way we enjoy it).

if you're in paris (porte de lilas), i would definitely recommend going here!; 2 coffee and a chocolate milk for our girl took 20 minutes… we also received suddenly some kinda baguette which we didn’t ordered. we decided to take a croissant with jam and go to the bakery across the street. croissant was served on a napkin with a bottle of jam. no plate or knife to open your croissant… the waiter grabbed the croissants out of a bag with his hands and put it at the napkin. what about the hygiene? 🤔; you can enjoy simple food in the evening, and the owner is friendly and it was a good experience 😁; great restaurant, prices are fair, especially for paris. we paid 70euro and still had some food leftover to take home (4 people) the dining experience was enjoyable, the rice, vegetables and fish were adequate, fair for the price. the cheeseburger (i ordered no pickles) was delicious, the fries were well cooked and the mayo... the mayo was so good, it was clearly homemade, if i had to pick one condiment to eat forever, this would be it.
staff was very polite, very enjoyable; café de la mairie was our favourite place to eat in the area. the most amazing experience.  the food and the service were amazing.  whenever we return to paris we will definitely be back.",48.87919970000001,2.4130247,0.4693333333333334,True,0.5333333333333333,1,93260,Café_93260_3956,True

for my main course, i opted for the steak, and it did not disappoint. the steak was cooked to perfection—tender, juicy, and full of flavor. the accompanying sides complemented the dish well, enhancing the overall dining experience.

the wine selection at paul chez was also impressive. our server recommended a wonderful red wine that paired perfectly with both the tartar and the steak, adding an extra dimension to our meal.

the ambiance of the restaurant was charming and cozy, making it a perfect spot for a relaxed dinner. the service was attentive and friendly, contributing to a pleasant and memorable evening.

one minor downside was that the dessert menu was somewhat limited, but given the quality of the main dishes, this was a minor flaw.

overall, paul chez offers excellent food and a delightful dining experience. i highly recommend it for anyone visiting paris.

rating: 8.5/10; it was wonderful to have a nice dinner with. potato was really tasty, so hard to finish all food you have ordered.  i think 4 person - 2 starter / 3 main dishes / 2 dessert / 1~2 bottle of wine to share would be perfect and enough. for sure, foods in here is wonderful.; very french restaurant as my french friend said.
very good food.
good atmosphere, super busy service.
i recommend to call in advance to make sure you have seats.; a good restaurant for french dinner. baked snails had a nice butter flavor. beef tartar was my favorite. red wine pear with vanilla ice cream was an excellent dessert.; service was good. they ignored me just the right amount.
nice atmosphere, outside.
the pepper steak was excellent, perhaps a tad less tender than i would like, and the sauce was very peppery, but flavorful. the potatoes surprised me with flavor and creaminess.
the goat cheese and salad was a delightful combination.

i am pretty tough generally on the traditional brasserie/bistrot. here is a great find. i will be back",48.8528198,2.3743556,0.0,True,0.0,0,75011,Chez_75011_3967,False

with 40-50€/person, you can definitely get better food easily elsewhere!

now (3 years later i came back here because of an event organized by my company), i still find the portions very small, the pasta very oily, even more expensive and not worth the price (150gr pasta for 20€). the menu still only in italian and not very clear, the deserts not very tasty.
the spritz aperol was good though, the service friendly, but the decorations are very disturbing: nudity drawn in black perm-marker on a transparent plastic sheet all over the wall and on the table serving as a table mat... 😱
